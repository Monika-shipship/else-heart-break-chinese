Welcome to Dorisburg!
欢迎来到多里斯堡！
由 iq.gobo 制作
This guide will help you settle in your new home and familiarize with what our nice town has to offer to the explorative adventurer.
本指南将助您在新家园安顿下来，熟悉我们这座友善小镇为探索型冒险家提供的各项资源。
We don't want to spoil too much of the fun right from the start, so the further you dig into this treasure chest of information, the more in depth the information will get. And to be clear: it will get more spoilery the more you advance down this page!
我们不想从一开始就剥夺太多探索乐趣，因此您在这座信息宝库中挖掘得越深，获得的内容就越详尽。需要明确的是：随着您不断向下翻阅，剧透内容会逐渐增加！

The first three chapters are safe to be consumed by anyone and are especially geared towards beginners and first timers.
前三章内容适合所有玩家阅读，特别适合新手和初次接触的玩家。

Starting with the fourth chapter, I am giving away knowledge that can seriously impact your game exprience, so the later chapters should only be read by people who are helplessly stuck or have completed the storyline at least once on their own.
从第四章开始，我将透露会严重影响游戏体验的关键信息，因此后续章节仅建议卡关无法自拔或已独立完成至少一次主线剧情的玩家阅读。

General info: about the game and interface
游戏基本信息：关于游戏与界面介绍
Else Heart.Break() is split into two main gameplay mechanics: a 3D point & click adventure and a programming challenge/sandbox.
《Else Heart.Break()》主要包含两大核心玩法：三维点击式冒险与编程挑战/沙盒模式。
Depending on how quickly and thoroughly you explore the open world that is the city of Dorisburg, you will have access to the coding part after just a few minutes or several hours.
根据你在开放世界多里斯堡的探索速度与深入程度，仅需数分钟或数小时即可解锁编程功能。
If you really want to get straight into the matrix, scroll way down to chapter six, there will be a section about how to access the nessessary equipment early on, without even starting any missions.
若想直接切入数字矩阵世界，请直接跳转至第六章，该章节将介绍如何在不触发任何任务的前提下，提前获取必要装备。

For the rest of the readers, who want to enjoy the experience at their own pace, keep reading, as this chapter is all about the adventuring part.
对于想要按照自己节奏体验游戏的读者们，请继续阅读，本章节将全面介绍冒险环节的内容。

You play as Sebastian, the orange hooded fellow who just scored a job at a soda retailer. The camera can be swiveled with while holding the right mouse button, but you can also use the left and right cursor keys or "a" and "d". And I strongly encourage you to get used to the keyboard controls for the camera, because otherwise you will trigger unintentional interactions with objects once you release the right mousebutton.
你将扮演塞巴斯蒂安——那位刚在汽水零售店找到工作的橙帽小伙。按住鼠标右键可以旋转视角，但同样可以使用左右方向键或"A"和"D"键进行操作。我强烈建议你习惯使用键盘控制视角，否则松开鼠标右键时可能会意外触发与物体的互动。
This might even result in the loss of an item if you happen to be carrying something in your hand while you release the right mouse button over a trashcan. You have been warned!
如果你手持物品时在垃圾桶上方松开右键，甚至可能导致物品丢失。特此提醒！

You can also zoom in and out with the up and down cursor keys or "w" and "s", and those actions cannot be performed with the mouse.
你还可以通过上下方向键或"W"和"S"键进行视角缩放，这些操作无法通过鼠标完成。
On the other hand, moving the mouse up or down while holding the right mouse button will change the angle the camera takes to focus on the main character, which cannot be done with the keyboard alone, so in the end you will learn how to use both the mouse and the keyboard to keep the view to your liking.
另一方面，按住鼠标右键的同时上下移动鼠标可以调整镜头聚焦主角的角度，这是仅靠键盘无法实现的操作，因此最终你需要学会结合使用鼠标和键盘来保持理想的视角。

One thing that can be quite irritating is that this game has no option to fade out objects blocking your camera view, so you can end up seeing essentially nothing. Keep calm and prefer to use the keyboard controls in that case.
有个相当恼人的设定是这款游戏没有提供镜头视野遮挡物淡出选项，这可能导致你眼前一片漆黑。遇到这种情况请保持冷静，尽量优先使用键盘操控。

Conversations are of course presented as a classical multiple choice dialog, but with two distinct quirks that set this game apart in some regard.
对话系统虽然采用经典的多选对话模式，但具备两项独特机制，使本作在这方面显得别具一格。
First off, the speech bubbles at the bottom of the screen that represent your possible answers or inquiries can get very wide and overlap with each other, making the text below difficult to read.
首先，屏幕底部代表可选回答或提问的对话气泡会变得异常宽大，甚至相互重叠，导致下方文字难以辨认。
You can wiggle your mouse while hovering the options, but it might take a while for the game to recognize that you are interested in something blocked by something else.
你可以在悬停选项时晃动鼠标，但游戏可能需要一些时间才能识别出你对被其他物体遮挡的内容感兴趣。
If you take too long though, the game will chose which line of dialog Sebastian will deliver next and it might not be what you would like him to say. It doesn't matter in the long run, but at least keep it in mind and don't think too bad about it.
不过如果耗时过久，游戏会自动选择塞巴斯蒂安的下一条对话台词，这可能并非你希望他说的内容。从长远来看这并无大碍，但至少请记住这一点，不必对此过于介怀。
You can never give the wrong reply and fail a mission or something, but there are some best picks to get a bit more information out of a NPC or do a mission in a more relaxed way that you can miss if you get lazy and let the automated choices run your conversations.
你永远不会因选错回复而导致任务失败，但若偷懒放任自动选项主导对话，可能会错过某些最佳选择——这些选项能让你从 NPC 处获取更多情报，或以更从容的方式完成任务。

While Dorisburg is presented as an open world to explore, it is not seamless. Doors and certain transitional areas like streets will indicate a loading screen to shift to a new area by a big orange arrow.
虽然多里斯堡以开放世界的形态呈现，但区域间并非无缝衔接。当遇到门扉或街道等过渡区域时，巨大的橙色箭头会提示加载界面，表明即将切换至新场景。
But it works like a seamless map as the position of objects or the path a NPC walks will be preserved over those area changes.
但其运作却如同一张无缝地图，因为物品位置或 NPC 行走路径在区域切换时都会得以保留。
Only one person can travel such a connection at a time, so sometimes you will get a message at the top right of the screen that asks you to wait a bit before you can use the door again or keep walking a street to get to the new place.
每次仅限一人通过此类连接通道，因此有时屏幕右上角会显示提示信息，要求你稍作等待才能再次使用这扇门，或是继续沿街道前行抵达新区域。
On a side note, objects can block the path to a map transition, so it is possible to keep NPCs from walking to certain areas if you care to set up such restrictions. Just keep in mind that those barricades will hinder your own movement as well.
值得一提的是，物品会阻挡地图过渡点的路径，因此若你有意设置此类限制，完全可以阻止 NPC 进入特定区域。只需注意这些路障同样会阻碍你自身的移动。

The world is made out of a rectangular grid and while it will take a while to get to know which coordinates someone or something is positioned at, the tiled nature of the game is obvious once you observe that only one item can be placed on its own.
世界由矩形网格构成，虽然需要时间熟悉人物或物品所处的具体坐标，但当你观察到每个图格仅能放置一件独立物品时，游戏的瓦片化本质便一目了然。
Stacks of objects can only be done by editing a level, not while playing the game.
物品堆叠只能通过编辑关卡实现，无法在游戏过程中进行。
So if you want to collect all the floppy disks and stash them someplace, be prepared that this will require a large area.
因此若想收集所有软盘并集中存放，请做好需要占用大片区域的准备。

If you took an item from an elevated point like a table and did not move one bit, chances are you will be able to put the item right back where it came from.
如果你从桌面等高处拾取物品后未曾移动，大概率能将物品放回原处。
But picking up something and walking over to a table with the intention to drop that thing on the table will most likely be impossible.
但若想拾起物品后走到桌边将其放置在桌上，则基本无法实现。

Speaking of items and objects: anything you can interact with will be indicated by a pink box while you hover it with the mouse.
说到物品和交互对象：当你用鼠标悬停在可交互物品上时，会显示粉色边框作为提示。
Left clicking will always "use" that thing, but depending on your equipment there might also be an option to interact with the object using the right mouse button as well.
左键点击总是会"使用"该物品，但根据你当前装备的不同，有时还可以通过右键点击来与物品进行额外交互。
For example, right at the start of the game in your parent's house you can go to the kitchen and left click the stove to turn it on.
例如游戏刚开始在父母家时，你可以走进厨房左键点击炉灶来打开火源。
But if you pick up a bun from the dinner table first and get back to the stove, there will be a second option to right click the stove and cook or rather burn the bun.
但如果你先从餐桌上拾取小圆面包再回到炉灶旁，就会出现第二个交互选项——右键点击炉灶来烹饪（或者更准确说是烤焦）这个小圆面包。

When you pick up an item, you are holding it in your hand. While in your hand, the left of the screen might display some further options for actions that can be taken with the current object.
当你拾起一件物品时，它会出现在你手中。手持物品时，屏幕左侧可能会显示针对当前物品的进一步操作选项。
The bun could be eaten for example, or put into your bag, your always available inventory.
比如这个面包可以直接食用，或是放进你随身携带的背包里。
If you are holding one thing and then pick up something else, the game will try to put your first item into your bag automatically. If your bag is at max capacity (at 16 IIRC), you have to put the current item down before you can pick up the second one.
如果你手持某件物品时又拾取了新物品，游戏会尝试将第一件物品自动放入背包。若背包已达容量上限（没记错的话是 16 格），你必须先放下当前手持的物品才能拾取第二件。
Try not to hoard stuff and keep a slim inventory.
请尽量避免囤积物品，保持背包精简。

The inventory can be accessed by clicking the "open bag" button at the upper right part of the screen. Click any item from your bag to put it in your hand, possibly swapping it with the object you held there before.
点击屏幕右上角的"打开背包"按钮即可访问背包。从背包中点击任意物品可将其持于手中，可能会替换之前手持的物品。
Later in the game you might find additional suitcases to carry around and essentially boost your inventory space, but in my opinion it is not worth it, as putting something into an inventory other than your bag can be quite a chore and the button for the secondary inventory can block a fair size of the screen, keeping you from clicking items underneath in the game world.
游戏后期你可能会找到额外的手提箱来携带，本质上能扩充背包空间，但在我看来并不值得，因为将物品放入非主背包的储物空间操作相当繁琐，且次要储物空间的按钮会遮挡相当大面积的屏幕，导致你无法点击游戏场景下方的物品。

Above the bag button, you can see the current time and how much money you own. Sadly, money does not really play any significant role in this game, so lets concentrate on the clock first.
在背包按钮上方，你可以查看当前时间和持有金额。遗憾的是金钱在游戏中并无实际重要作用，所以我们先重点关注时钟功能。
The people of Dorisburg will perform their daily routines and Sebastian will get tired after walking around for too long. So they both will want to get to their bed every now and then. If Sebastian does not make it to a bed in time, he will pass out on the spot after a while.
多里斯堡的居民会按照日常作息活动，而塞巴斯蒂安长时间行走后也会感到疲倦。因此他们都需要时不时回到床上休息。如果塞巴斯蒂安未能及时找到床铺，一段时间后就会当场昏迷。
But don't worry, sleeping on the sidewalk is fine in this game and you can even rest in any bed you come across, as long as there is not someone else occuping the bed at the time.
不过别担心，在这款游戏里睡人行道完全没问题，你甚至可以在遇到的任何一张床上休息——只要当时没有其他人正占用着床铺。

This also means that a NPC will not stay put in one place all the time. They will get out of bed, walk to work, spend their evening at the bar, the cafe or whatever they prefer and finally get back home.
这也意味着 NPC 不会始终待在同一个地方。他们会起床、步行上班、晚上去酒吧或咖啡馆消遣，最后再回到家中。
Everyone has their own place to live and in most cases to work, but how they spend their time off may vary.
每个人都有属于自己的住所，大多情况下也有工作场所，但他们的闲暇时光安排却各不相同。

As I said, don't worry about money in this game. There are ways to both spent some and acquire lots of it, but there is no real point in doing so. But in addition to the every visible cash display, Sebastian carries a credit card in his bag.
正如我说过的，不必为游戏里的金钱操心。虽然既有花钱的途径也有赚钱的门路，但刻意积累财富并没有实际意义。不过除了随处可见的现金显示外，塞巴斯蒂安的背包里还带着一张信用卡。
If you make a purchase, he will hand the card over to the shopkeeper by clicking the "give" button of the credit card's options on the left side of the screen. Other items, like drinks, can be given to other people as well, so keep that in mind.
如果你要进行购买，他需要通过点击屏幕左侧信用卡选项中的"给予"按钮将卡片交给店主。其他物品，比如饮料，也可以赠予他人，请记住这一点。
Once you start hacking, you will definately want to ceck out your credit card, but it is secured by a higher access level than your first hacking gear will be able to handle.
一旦开始黑客行动，你肯定会想查看自己的信用卡信息，但它的安全访问等级较高，初期的黑客设备无法破解。
Dorisburg sightseeing: the map and the city
多里斯堡观光指南：地图与城市导览
Some people have a hard time getting to know where they are, where something they want to go to is and generally make sense of how all of the different areas of the game come together.
有些玩家很难弄清自己所在的位置、目标地点的方位，以及游戏中各区域之间的关联布局。

There is no quest tracker and no big arrow pointing towards your target like in your typical MMORPG. But Else Heart.Break() is of much smaller scale, so don't fret, you'll get to know the place very quickly.
这里没有任务追踪器，也没有像传统 MMORPG 那样指向目标的大箭头。但《Else Heart.Break()》的规模要小得多，所以别担心，你很快就能熟悉这个地方。

Once you get off the boat and arrive in the city, walk into the tourist office and grab a map from the counter. Even if you don't have the map in your hand, you can press "m" as long as you have one in your bag and the map screen shows up:
下船抵达城市后，走进游客中心从柜台拿张地图。即使手上没拿地图，只要背包里有地图，按下"M"键就能打开地图界面：


The first area you see of the city is at the pink circled "i" almost at the center of the map. The red framed ship is the one you took to get here. All the different parts of the city are marked by a black border.
你最初抵达的城区位于地图中央粉色圆圈标注的"i"符号处。红色方框标记的船只就是你乘坐来此的交通工具。城市各个区域都用黑色边框进行划分。

The double red lines that go through most of them is the city's public transportation system. The inner ring goes about clockwise, the outer ring travels the opposite direction. Bridges are shown as a mix of yellow, orange and red.
贯穿大部分区域的红色双线是城市公共交通系统。内环线按顺时针方向行驶，外环线则反向运行。桥梁以黄橙红三色混合标示。


The area north of your starting area leads to other parts of the harbor. While you can find something interesting all over the place, most people will want to explore the parts to the east first instead.
起始区域以北通往港口的其他区域。虽然四处都能发现有趣的事物，但多数玩家会更倾向于优先探索东部区域。

The area right next to the tourist info contains the Hotel Devotchka, which has a room booked for you by your new employer, Wellspring Soda.
游客信息中心隔壁就是德沃奇卡酒店，你的新雇主泉涌汽水公司已在此为你预订了房间。

This is one of your main points of interest.
这是你的主要兴趣点之一。

South of the hotel across the bridge are the burrows and the north eastern exit of the burrows leads to the plaza. Those three central sections are probably the areas you will visit most often throughout the game, so take your time to get familiar with them.
酒店南侧过桥即是地下聚居区，而聚居区东北出口则通向中心广场。这三个核心区域很可能成为你在游戏中最常造访的地点，不妨多花些时间熟悉环境。

The map indicates the cardinal directions and the keen observer might have noticed, that your camera view always rotates to face to the north every time you open the map. This is a great feature that even works indoors.
地图上标有基本方位，细心的玩家可能已经注意到，每次打开地图时视角都会自动旋转至正北方向。这个贴心设计即便在室内场景也依然有效。
If you open the map and think something you are interested in is to the east, just walk to the right/east after you close the map without turning your camera again and you will head into the correct direction.
若打开地图后发现目标地点位于东方，只需在关闭地图后直接向右/向东行走，无需再次调整视角即可朝正确方向前进。

There are also a great number of white framed blue signs all over the place that will point you in the right direction as well.
遍布各处的白框蓝底指示牌也能为您指引方向。

If you really got lost and don't know where you are, try to find the railway tracks and walk besides those to find one of the stations. You might have to wait a bit, but once a train car arrives, feel free to enter as you don't need a ticket to ride.
若彻底迷失方位，不妨沿着铁路轨道行走寻找车站。虽然可能需要稍作等待，但列车到站后即可免费搭乘——无需购票即可乘车。
When the train gets close to a station, the station's name is displayed to the upper right of the screen.
当列车接近车站时，车站名称会显示在屏幕右上角。

Additionally, you can sit on the bench in the cabin and your view sill shift to the outside, so you can watch the city pass by as you go along the tracks. That can give you a overlook of the city as well.
此外，你可以坐在车厢长椅上，视角将自动切换到窗外，让你能沿着轨道欣赏城市掠影。这也能让你俯瞰整座城市的景色。
As an added benefit, Sebastian will not tire while seated, so you can ride the train as long as you like without falling asleep.
额外的好处是，塞巴斯蒂安在坐着时不会感到疲倦，因此你可以随心所欲地乘坐列车，不必担心会睡着。

The dark colored parts on the map are buildings of course. You wont find detailed maps for them, but for the most part, they are really straightforward and easy to navigate.
地图上深色区域自然是建筑物。虽然找不到它们的详细地图，但大多数建筑内部结构都非常直观，极易穿行。

Later in the game you will find ways to get around places much more quickly, but up until then, walking and taking the train will be your main ways of getting around town.
在游戏后期，你将找到更快捷的移动方式，但在此之前，步行和乘坐火车将是你在城镇中出行的主要方式。

As the closing word for this chapter I'd like to point out that while there are some discrepancies between the map and the actual game world, the abstraction is very well accurate enoug to move around the city easily.
作为本章结语，我想指出虽然地图与实际游戏世界存在些许差异，但这种抽象化处理已足够精确，能让你轻松地在城市中穿行。
The southern of the two parks for example is not accessible, while the northern one actually consists of two areas instead of just one.
例如南侧的两座公园中，其中一座无法进入，而北侧的公园实际上由两个区域组成，并非仅有一个。
You'll spot some other differences as well, like the northernmost strip of the plaza area that consists of a separate area on its own as well, or the hut/boat southeast of the hotel can be accessed from the general hotel vicinity without leaving the area first.
你还会发现其他差异，比如广场区最北端的狭长地带本身就是一个独立区域，又比如酒店东南侧的小屋/船只无需先离开当前区域，直接从酒店周边即可抵达。
As I said, small errors that don't really make a difference in the big picture.
正如我所说，这些细微差错在大局中其实无关紧要。
Bits replace atoms: the hacking interface
比特取代原子：黑客操作界面
As mentioned in the introduction, hacking is the other of the two main game elements in Else Heart.Break(). If you spend a good amount of time with something, it pays off to familiarize with the interface early on.
正如引言所述，黑客系统是《Else Heart.Break()》两大核心游戏元素之一。若你打算投入大量时间钻研，尽早熟悉操作界面将会事半功倍。

This chapter of the guide will tell you about some features and shortcomings of the code editting view in the game, but not really spoil any crucial part of the game itself.
本章指南将介绍游戏中代码编辑视图的部分特性与不足之处，但不会真正剧透游戏的核心内容。

You enter the editor interface whenever you hack something. Note that once you have a hacking device, there is no need to carry floppy disks to a computer with a floppy reader as you can read a disks contents without even picking it up.
每当你入侵某个设备时，就会进入编辑器界面。请注意，一旦拥有黑客设备，就无需将软盘带到带软驱的电脑前，因为即使不拾取软盘也能直接读取其中内容。

Let's start by mentioning the visible elements and their shortcuts:
首先介绍可见元素及其快捷键：

in the upper left is a button you can press to leave the editor view and save and run the code in its current state, which is the equivalent of pressing escape.
左上角有一个按钮，按下即可退出编辑器视图并保存运行当前代码，相当于按下 ESC 键。
embedded ino the hacking device is a "compile" button. Hitting this button (or pressing CTRL+ENTER) will perform a syntax check on your code rather than a compile in actual programming would do.
黑客设备内置"编译"按钮。按下此按钮（或按 CTRL+ENTER）将对代码执行语法检查，其功能类似于实际编程中的编译操作。
This means that errors in your syntax will be spotted by the ingame compiler, but you will still have to use the actions you programmed on the hardware it is running on to spot errors like using arithmetics on strings or something like that.
这意味着游戏内编译器会检测出你的语法错误，但你仍需通过在实际运行的硬件上执行编程的操作，才能发现诸如对字符串进行算术运算之类的错误。
"undo" is just like the undo you are used to from other editors and can also be invoked by pressing CTRL+Z
"撤销"功能与其他编辑器中常见的撤销操作相同，也可以通过按下 Ctrl+Z 快捷键来触发。
be cautious pressing the "reset" button on the lower right of the screen, as it will revert all changes done to the code and instead shows the initial content of the code window as left by the original author (i.e., not the player, essentially replacing anything wou wrote with the original content of the object).
请谨慎点击屏幕右下角的"重置"按钮，因为这将还原对代码所做的所有修改，恢复代码窗口最初由原作者留下的内容（即非玩家编写的内容，实际上会用对象的原始内容替换你写入的任何代码）。
Still helpfull if you were just messing around and broke something.
如果你只是随意调试时弄坏了某些功能，这个重置功能仍然很有帮助。

Keep in mind that the buttons are the only thing you can interact with your mouse in this view. You cannot click into the code window and place the cursor to that spot or mark a selection of text.
请记住，在此视图下，按钮是唯一能用鼠标交互的元素。你无法点击代码窗口将光标定位到特定位置，也无法选中文本片段。

Other than those buttons, you can see two black windows.
除了这些按钮外，你还能看到两个黑色窗口。

The big one is the code editor, with yellow line numbers running along the left side. You can write as many lines of code as you like (at least I didn't encounter any limitation myself) and scroll up and down by either using the cursor keys or page up and down.
较大的窗口是代码编辑器，左侧配有黄色行号标识。你可以编写任意多行代码（至少我个人未遇到限制），并通过方向键或翻页键进行上下滚动。
Take note though, that the editor is unable to scroll to the right! You can still write outside of the visible space and the code will run just fine, but for the most part, you will want to keep all your code visible without overflowing to the right.
但需注意：编辑器不支持横向滚动！虽然编写超出可视区域的代码仍能正常运行，但大多数情况下建议保持所有代码在可视范围内，避免横向溢出。

While in the code editor, you can use common features like SHIFT+cursor keys to mark a selection of text pr CTRL+a to mark all text. CTRL+x, CTRL+c and CTRL+v to cut, copy and paste.
在代码编辑器中，你可以使用常见功能，例如使用 SHIFT+方向键来标记文本选区，或使用 CTRL+a 来标记所有文本。使用 CTRL+x、CTRL+c 和 CTRL+v 进行剪切、复制和粘贴操作。
It is worth mentioning that the clipboard you are using in those cases is your native operating system's clipboard.
值得一提的是，你在这些操作中使用的剪贴板是你本地操作系统的剪贴板。
Which means you are not only able to copy code from one object in the game to another, but you can also copy and paste to and from other windows running on your computer alongside the game itself!
这意味着你不仅可以在游戏中的不同对象之间复制代码，还可以在游戏运行时，与计算机上其他窗口之间进行复制粘贴操作！
So if you see some interesting code somewhere in this guide or elsewhere, just copy it and paste it right into your game. Or the other way around if you want to share ingame code with someone else.
因此，如果你在本指南或其他地方看到有趣的代码，只需复制并直接粘贴到游戏中。反之亦然，如果你想与他人分享游戏内代码。
Way better than swapping screenshots and manually typing text from pictures, right?
比来回切换截图、手动从图片里敲字强多了，对吧？

Another cool feature of the editor is TAB completion. For example, most of the time you can just type "pr" and hit TAB for the editor to expand "pr" into "Print(".
编辑器的另一个酷炫功能是 TAB 键自动补全。比如大多数时候，你只需输入"pr"再按 TAB 键，编辑器就会把"pr"扩展成"Print("。
Note that not only did the editor complete the command, but it also used proper capitalization and included an opening bracket. If the command in question does not take any arguments, even the closing parenthesis will be entered automatically.
注意编辑器不仅补全了指令，还自动规范了大小写并添加了左括号。如果该指令不需要参数，甚至连右括号都会自动输入。

If a command does take arguments, glance to the lower, smaller screen, where you will usually get some additional information on the ommand and the current argument.
若指令需要参数，只需瞥一眼下方的小屏幕——那里通常会显示该指令的补充说明及当前参数信息。
If you are not currently working on a command and place the cursor by itself, outside of a comment, the small screen will list all the commands the current device you are working on supports.
若当前未执行任何指令且光标位于注释之外，小型屏幕将列出当前操作设备支持的所有命令。
Keep in mind that the device may support more commands than what fits the small display, in which case you are encouraged to just start typing to narrow down the list of suggestions.
请注意，设备支持的指令数量可能超出小屏幕的显示范围，此时建议直接开始输入以缩小建议列表的范围。
Coming back to the Print() example above, somthing along those lines could happen in the lower monitor:
回到上文提到的 Print()示例，类似情况可能会在下部监视器中发生：

without typing anything yet, alll available commands are displayed
在尚未输入任何内容时，所有可用命令都会显示出来
typing "p" will narrow down the list of commands, for example to "Pitch", "PlaySound", "Position" and "Print"
输入"p"将缩小命令列表范围，例如筛选出"Pitch"、"PlaySound"、"Position"和"Print"
typing the second letter of the command will shrink the list to just one option in this case and allow you to hit TAB to complete the command and put it into the proper case.
输入命令的第二个字母会将列表缩减至唯一选项，此时按 TAB 键即可自动补全命令并转换为正确格式
if the command takes one or more arguments, the small screen will at least spell their names and usually display some clues about their nature
若命令需要接收一个或多个参数，小屏幕至少会显示参数名称，通常还会提供参数类型的提示信息

In the case of hitting an error while running your code, the hint screen in the editor will list error messages along with the lines they occured in to help you in finding and correcting them. Once you move the cursor though, the error messages will disappear.
当代码运行出现错误时，编辑器中的提示屏幕会列出错误信息及其所在行号，协助定位和修正问题。不过一旦移动光标，错误信息就会消失
If you want to see them again, just run the code once more and then hit CTRL+h to hack the device once it runs into the error again. As mentioned before, hitting "compile" will not help in that case, as only syntax errors can be found by that.
若想再次查看它们，只需重新运行代码，待程序再次报错时按下 CTRL+h 进行设备破解。如前所述，此时点击"编译"并无帮助，因为该功能仅能检测语法错误。

Observing existing code and exploring the available commands are key elements of the hacking part of the game.
观察现有代码并探索可用指令是游戏破解环节的核心要素。
When working through the ingame missions you only need to correct or rearrange existing code, but by making use of other commands not present in the original program you can come up with more generalized solutions or access features otherwise hidden.
完成游戏内置任务时，你只需修正或重组现有代码，但通过运用原始程序中未包含的其他指令，你可以构建更通用的解决方案或解锁隐藏功能。
So you are strongly encouraged to experiment. If you really think you got to a point where nothing works at all, just "reset" the editor and either start over, or go tinker with something completly different.
因此强烈建议你大胆尝试。若确实陷入束手无策的境地，直接"重置"编辑器即可——或重新开始，或转而钻研完全不同的内容。

As mentioned above, you can read floppy disks with the hacking device, but you can also edit their contents! Because of that I usually keep one disk with me all the time to take notes.
如上所述，你可以用黑客设备读取软盘，还能编辑其中的内容！因此我通常会随身携带一张软盘用来记录笔记。
And a second one to contain a mighty code computers can boot off of and connect to all sorts of other objects for various features.
第二张软盘则存放着强大的启动代码，计算机能够通过它启动并连接各类设备，实现多种功能。
Floppies are really useful in this game :)
软盘在这款游戏中确实非常实用 :)

Fun fact: the line numbers in the editor only show up to 3 digits.
冷知识：编辑器中的行号最多只显示三位数。

Bonus hint: some devices in the game have a CopyToClipboard() command that you can use for just that, copy anything to the clipboard from within your code.
额外提示：游戏中的某些设备配备了 CopyToClipboard()指令，你可以直接使用它从代码中将任何内容复制到剪贴板。
Sprak 101: some easy code snippets
Sprak 101：简易代码片段集锦
This section aims to be spoiler free as well, so I will not disclose any code that helps you advance in the story.
本节内容同样力求避免剧透，因此不会透露任何有助于推进剧情发展的代码。
Well, technically I do, if you consider the mystical cube challenges you might get from Hank or Fib while they teach you Sprak in the game, but those are purely optional and are explained ingame as well.
严格来说，如果你把汉克或菲布在游戏中教你 Sprak 时可能给的神秘立方体挑战算进去，我确实透露了些许代码——不过这些挑战完全属于可选内容，游戏内也会提供详细说明。
So it is some kind of gray area and up to you if you want to continue reading or not, but I will not hide the code behind spoiler tags. Hm, providing the names of those characters can be considered spoilers, too..
所以这算是某种灰色地带，是否继续阅读取决于你，但我不会用剧透标签隐藏代码。嗯，提供那些角色的名字也可能被视为剧透。

One of the easiest things to hack almost anywhere in Dorisburg with direct feedback are the many streetlamps. While it never happened to me, you might get caught fiddling with the lamps by one of those guys in suits.
在桃瑞丝堡最容易入侵且能直接获得反馈的地方就是遍布街头的路灯。虽然我从未遇到过，但你在摆弄路灯时可能会被那些穿西装的家伙逮个正着。
If in doubt of the outcome, save the game to have a point to revert to in case anything bad happens.
如果对结果存疑，请及时存档，以便在发生意外时能够回退到之前的进度。

So just walk up to a lamp and right click on the post to access the lamp's code once you have access to a hacking device. Move your cursor in the code window to an empty line and observe the small screen at the bottom, where available commands are listed.
当你获得黑客设备后，只需走近路灯，右键点击灯柱即可访问路灯的代码。将光标移至代码窗口的空白行，观察底部小屏幕上列出的可用指令。
In this demo, we will use the commands to make the light show different colors by using commands like sine, cosine, getting the current time and generating random numbers.
在本演示中，我们将使用正弦、余弦函数，获取当前时间并生成随机数等指令，让灯光呈现不同颜色。
The code below gets beyond what you might learn by talking to Fib, Hank or the other teachers in the game and show you how to define your own functions and call them.
以下代码将超越你通过与非布、汉克或游戏中其他老师交谈所学到的内容，展示如何定义并调用自定义函数。

var red = RandomBetween(0.1, 0.9) # Start of initialization code
var green = RandomBetween(0.1, 0.9)
var blue = RandomBetween(0.1, 0.9)

At the top, we define three variables. The "var" in this case sets the variables type to be anything.
在顶部，我们定义了三个变量。此处的 "var" 将变量类型设置为任意类型。
This is the most relaxed type you can assign to a variable, but in this case, where we are only working with numbers, we could have used "number" instead of "var" in the first three lines.
这是你可以为变量分配的最宽松类型，但在本例中，由于我们仅处理数字，前三个本可以使用 "number" 而非 "var"。

The three variables represent the three colors that make up any color that can be displayed by your monitor (kinda). The higher the value for one color, the brighter this color will shine when we run the code.
这三个变量代表了构成显示器可显示任何颜色的三原色（大致如此）。某个颜色的数值越高，运行代码时该颜色的显示就越明亮。

Usually, "Random()" will get you a fractional or floating point number between 0 and 1. Which is fine for this use case, but you can set the color to values higher than one to make the lamp shine brighter in a higher radius.
通常情况下，"Random()"函数会生成一个介于 0 到 1 之间的小数或浮点数。对于这个应用场景来说这没问题，但你可以将颜色值设置为大于 1 的数值，让灯在更大半径范围内发出更亮的光芒。

Instead of just calling "Random()", the code contains the function "RandomBetween()" that expects the lower and upper bounds you expect your random numbers to get. This is done by a simple formula inside of the function.
代码中并非直接调用"Random()"，而是包含了一个"RandomBetween()"函数，该函数需要你输入期望随机数取值的上下界。这是通过函数内部的一个简单公式实现的。
Please note that the function itself returns a number, so the first keyword in the definition of the function is "number" at the start of the line.
请注意函数本身返回的是数值，因此函数定义行的第一个关键字是位于行首的"number"。
Both parameters, "low" and "high", are numbers as well.
两个参数"low"和"high"同样也是数值类型。

So we use "RandomBetween()" to initialize the values for red, green and blue to something random between 0.1 and 0.9.
因此我们使用"RandomBetween()"函数将红、绿、蓝三个通道的初始值随机设定在 0.1 到 0.9 之间。
This will most likely assign different values to each of the three variables though, not the same to each one, as every time you call "RandomBetween()", a new random number is generated.
不过这样很可能会给三个变量分配不同的数值，而非相同的数值，因为每次调用"RandomBetween()"函数时都会生成一个新的随机数。

After the initialization in the first three lines, we enter a loop on line 5. A loop that just consists of "loop" on the first line will run forever, it is an infinite loop. So the streetlight will run this piece of code over and over and over.
在前三行完成初始化后，我们在第五行进入循环。仅由首行"loop"构成的循环会无限运行，这是一个死循环。因此路灯会反复不断地执行这段代码。
If you delete the lines "loop" and "end" (six lines below), the lamp will only assign random values once and keep them until you kick the post again.
如果删除"loop"和六行后的"end"这两行代码，路灯将仅会分配一次随机数值，并保持这些数值直到你再次踢击灯柱。

Next up is the "RandomChange()" function, but it calls all three remaining functions "Min()", "Max()" and "Clamp()" inside its function body.
接下来是"RandomChange()"函数，但它在函数体内调用了剩下的三个函数："Min()"、"Max()"和"Clamp()"。

"Min()" and "Max()" both work as expected if you ever did a formula in Excel for example: you provide two numbers, and the functions return either the smaller or the bigger one. Why do we do that?
"Min()"和"Max()"的功能与您在 Excel 中编写公式时的表现一致：输入两个数字，函数将返回较小或较大的那个值。我们为什么要这样做呢？
It is easier to read than a nested conditional (the "if" and "else" parts) littered throughout your code every time you need to pick one of two values.
这比在代码中到处使用嵌套条件语句（"if"和"else"部分）来从两个值中选取一个更易于阅读。

This is demonstrated in the "Clamp()" function, which takes three parameters: an input value and both a lower and upper bounds.
这一点在"Clamp()"函数中得到了体现，该函数接收三个参数：一个输入值以及上下限边界。
So this function wil make sure that the first parameter is inside of the range defined by the second and third parameter, clipping it to either one if the initial value is outside of that range. Very useful!
因此，该函数将确保第一个参数始终处于第二和第三参数定义的范围内，若初始值超出该范围则自动截取至边界值。非常实用！
On the inside of "Clamp()" we just call "Min()" and "Max()" in a clever way to achieve that. You could do it the other way around, too: "return Min(high, Max(low, value))" would result in the same output!
在"Clamp()"函数内部，我们通过巧妙调用"Min()"和"Max()"来实现这一功能。当然也可以采用相反的方式："return Min(high, Max(low, value))" 同样能实现完全相同的输出效果！

Why did we bother to do all of that? Well, on the one hand I wanted to show you how to do your own functions and use them, on the other hand we can use those three functions to make a smoother changing random number generator in "RandomChange()".
为何要大费周章实现这些功能？一方面是想向大家展示如何创建自定义函数并灵活运用，另一方面我们可以利用这三个函数在"RandomChange()"中构建出变化更平缓的随机数生成器。

"RandomChange()" looks similar to the "RandomBetween()" function, but only takes one argument and subtracts something instead of adding it.
"RandomChange()"函数结构与"RandomBetween()"相似，但仅需接收单个参数，并且执行的是减法运算而非加法。
Essentially, we generate a random number that is twice as tall as the variance we got as an input, then we subtract the original variance again. Why? Well, if we want our number to change by plus or minus 0.3 as shown above, we just provide 0.
本质上，我们生成一个随机数，其高度是输入方差的两倍，然后再次减去原始方差。为什么这样做？如果我们希望数值像上面展示的那样在±0.3 范围内变化，只需将 0.
3 as the variance parameter and the function internally generates a random number between 0 and 0.6. Then it subtracts 0.3, so the resulting value really lies between -0.3 and +0.3!
3 作为方差参数传入，函数内部就会生成 0 到 0.6 之间的随机数。接着减去 0.3，最终得到的数值确实会落在-0.3 到+0.3 之间！

The green variable in the loop not only calls the "RandomChange()" function, but it also wraps that inside a call to "Clamp()". This way we make sure that the number changes only in the range of 0 to 3, but each time the loop runs the number will only change by at most 0.
循环中的绿色变量不仅调用了"RandomChange()"函数，还将其嵌套在"Clamp()"调用中。通过这种方式，我们确保数值仅在 0 到 3 的范围内变化，但每次循环运行时，数值最多只会向任意方向变动 0.
3 in either direction, plus or minus.
3，无论是正向还是负向。

Lastly, the blue variable changes depending on the time of the day. "Time()" gives the current ingame time as a number, so "800" would be "8 in the morning" and "1730" would be "halb past five in the afternoon".
最后，蓝色变量会根据一天中的时间而变化。"Time()"函数以数字形式返回当前游戏内时间，例如"800"代表"早上 8 点"，"1730"代表"下午五点半"。
The sine function "Sin()" will return values between -1 and +1, but by wrapping it in our "Clamp()" function, we discard the negative part and ensure we have a positive result.
正弦函数"Sin()"的返回值在-1 到+1 之间，但通过将其包裹在"Clamp()"函数中，我们可以舍弃负值部分，确保获得正值结果。
Depending on the time of the day we will get a strong blue hue or not see traces of blue at all.
根据一天中的不同时段，我们将看到强烈的蓝色色调，或者完全看不到蓝色痕迹。

This should give you a good starting point to play with the numbers or swapping the function calls around and see what changes. Try to use only "RandomChange()" like the green variable in my example to have a smooth pulse of color.
这应该能为你提供一个良好的起点，你可以尝试调整数值或调换函数调用位置来观察变化。建议像示例中的绿色变量那样仅使用"RandomChange()"函数，以实现平滑的色彩脉动效果。
Exchange "Sin()" for "Cos()" and see how it affects the blue hue. Make "green = red" and "blue = red" before calling "SetColor()" to have the lamp just change intensity of white light instead of emitting colored light.
将 "Sin()" 替换为 "Cos()"，观察其对蓝色色调的影响。在调用 "SetColor()" 前设置 "green = red" 和 "blue = red"，使灯具仅改变白光强度而不发射彩色光。
Change the "Sleep()" parameter to slow down the changes in color by waiting longer at the end of each loop iteration. See what other uses of the available commands you can come up with. Try to really understand the helper functions I wrote for this example.
调整 "Sleep()" 参数，通过在每个循环迭代结束时等待更长时间来减缓颜色变化。尝试探索可用命令的其他用途。请务必深入理解我为此示例编写的辅助函数。

Enter the code.
输入代码。
Let the spoilers begin: notable items and locations
剧透预警：值得注意的物品与地点
While the first few chapters only gave general ideas and information without giving away anything of the game's contents, starting with this chapter we are entering full spoiler territory! I cannot stress this point enough: only continue reading this guide if you can't make it any further on your own or have completed the game yourself at least once.
虽然前几章仅提供了大致概念和基本信息而未透露游戏具体内容，但从本章开始我们将完全进入剧透领域！我必须再三强调：除非您实在无法凭自身能力推进游戏进度，或已至少通关一次，否则请勿继续阅读本指南。

Even though I warned you of the following contents, I will make use of the spoiler tags so you don't stumble upon any of this by just glacing over the guide.
即便已对后续内容发出警告，我仍将使用防剧透标签，确保您在快速浏览指南时不会意外窥见任何关键信息。

所以您不在乎剧情，只想以最快速度坠入兔子洞，与游戏来场零距离接触？请自便，尽情享受剧透的乐趣吧！

There are several ways to get access to a hacking device early on.
有几种方法可以在游戏早期获得黑客设备。

The most reliable free one
最可靠的免费方式

Once you arrive in Dorisburg, head east until you reach the closed hospital. To the north, but still in the area of the hospital, you can enter a building with two apartments.
抵达多丽丝堡后，向东行进直至抵达封闭医院。在医院的北侧区域，你可以进入一栋拥有两间公寓的建筑。
Enter the one on the left, without the rainbow colored doormat, to find a hack dev on the couch table just behind the big screen.
进入左侧没有彩虹色门垫的公寓，就能在巨幕电视正后方的茶几上找到黑客设备。



The quickest, costly one
最快捷但昂贵的方式




Once you arrive in Dorisburg, head one area to the north. The purple building with the pixely animated pipe on the outside and the curved staircase to the second floor just in front of the northern bridge has one up for purchase at $100.
抵达多丽丝堡后，向北前进一个区域。那栋外墙装有像素动画管道、北侧桥梁正前方设有弧形楼梯通往二层的紫色建筑内，可花费 100 美元购买该设备。
Once you have the hack dev, you can work some terminals or slot machines to regain the money easily.
获得黑客开发设备后，您可以通过操作终端机或老虎机轻松赚回资金。

As we are deep within the spoiler warning, here are some notable locations: the computers at the tourist info, the shoe shop or the soda storage can be used to register sales worth any amount to your account.
鉴于已进入剧透警告范围，以下是一些值得注意的地点：旅游信息中心的电脑、鞋店或汽水储藏室均可用于将任意金额的销售记录登记至您的账户。
The house just north of the cafe has an apartment on the lower floor, that contains a slot machine which can be tweaked to give better chances to win, higher rewards and/or lower cost to play.
咖啡馆北边的房子里，底层有间公寓，里面放着一台可调试的老虎机。通过调整，你能提高中奖几率、增加奖励金额，甚至降低游玩成本。
You could even hack it to reward you money for playing it, instead of costing money to give it a shot.
你甚至能把它破解成"玩就送钱"模式，再也不用花钱试手气。







The lucky one
幸运儿
This one is only accessible in about 15% of the games, so it might not be possible to get it there at the start of your run. Go all the way south through the burrows to the ministry and then walk behind the building.
这个场景仅在约 15%的游戏中可进入，所以开局时未必能触发。你需要一路向南穿过地洞抵达政务部，然后绕到建筑后方。
If you can't spot a hack dev there, either try one of the other ones or simply start new games until you get lucky.
如果在那里找不到黑客开发者，不妨试试其他地点，或者干脆不断开新游戏直到碰运气找到。




The scholar one
学者路线

Certain characters in this game will teach you Sprak, the ingame computer language. And at least one of them will "lend" you one of his spare devices, although as far as I know you are never expected to actually return it to him.
游戏中的某些角色会教你 Sprak 这门游戏内的计算机语言。至少有一位角色会"借"给你他的备用设备，不过据我所知，你实际上并不需要归还给他。
To get this one, you have to talk to Fib, the gardener, and make him offer you to teach you. I never bothered to go through this myself, so all I can do is give you some hints on where to find Fib most of the time.
要获得这个，你需要与园丁菲布交谈，让他主动提出教你。我从未亲自尝试过这个流程，所以只能告诉你菲布最常出现的位置线索。

Being a gardener by trade, he can usually be found in either part of the Dorisburg Gardens, the green park area between the burrows, plaza and cafe areas.
作为一名职业园丁，他通常会在多里斯堡花园的任意区域出现，这片绿色公园区域位于居民区、广场和咖啡馆之间。
He spends most of his spare time sitting on a bench near the hospital, but I also spotted him on benches at the plaza, the police station and near the cafe.
他大部分闲暇时间都坐在医院附近的长椅上，但我也曾在广场、警察局和咖啡馆附近的长椅上见过他。








The regular one
常规款




This is how most players will get their first hacking device, so the spoiler in this case is walking you through most of the steps necessary to get to it.
大多数玩家将通过这种方式获得首台黑客设备，因此本指南将详细讲解获取过程中所需的大部分步骤。

Not sure if this is really needed, but check into your hotel to start the weird door fixing sequnce and also to see the office door and the computer at the reception there.
不确定这是否真的必要，但先去酒店办理入住，这会开启诡异的修门序列，同时也能看到办公室门和前台的那台电脑。
After staying the night in your room, you will also find a floppy on the corridor floor containing some hints about suspicious activity at the plaza and a place called the Lodge.
在客房里过夜后，你还会在走廊地板上发现一张软盘，里面记录着关于广场上可疑活动以及一个名为"山居"地点的线索。

Visit Bar Yvonne in the basement of the house at the north end of the plaza at the evening or early night to meet Pixie, the girl in the blue skirt on the dance floor. Flirt with her to really start the main story line.
傍晚或入夜时分，前往广场北端房屋地下室的伊冯娜酒吧，遇见舞池里那位穿蓝裙子的女孩皮克茜。与她调情才能真正开启主线剧情。
Try following her to work the next day, when she enters the forbidden door in the shoe store. There are several ways to get through the door yourself, so here is the most obvious one: talk to the shopkeeper, Nini, and bring her a cigarette.
次日可以尝试尾随她去上班，当她进入鞋店那扇禁门时。你有多种方法能自己穿过那扇门，这里提供最直接的方式：与店主妮妮交谈，并给她带一支香烟。
You have to place the cig in your hands to get the option to "give" it to her during your conversation, like how you did with your credit card when checking into the hotel. Once she leaves her desk to have a smoke outside, enter the door and head through the basement.
你得把香烟拿在手上，才能在对话时获得"递给她"的选项，就像你在酒店办理入住时递信用卡那样。等她离开办公桌去外面抽烟时，趁机进门穿过地下室。
You will find another reception desk and Felix guarding another locked door. Talking to him will lead to an option to have Pixie come out and talk to you. She'll be mad at you for stalking her, but have no grudge against you in the end.
你会看到另一个接待台，菲利克斯正把守着另一扇上锁的门。与他交谈会出现让皮克茜出来见你的选项。她会因你跟踪而生气，但最终并不会记恨你。

One of the following nights you will dream about Pixie. The next morning, the door to the office at the hotel's reception won't be locked. In the office you will find a key to hotel room 4, where a hacking device is hidden under a chair.
之后的某个夜晚你会梦见皮克茜。次日早晨，酒店前台的办公室门将不再上锁。在办公室里你能找到酒店 4 号房的钥匙，黑客设备就藏在那间房的一张椅子下面。

See, the regular one is the one that takes the most time to get and you might even stumble upon one of the other ones mentioned here before all of the events above take place.
你看，常规路线反而最耗时，甚至可能在上述事件发生前，你就已经偶然获得了这里提到的其他线索。


















There are several other hacking devices throughout the game, but as far as I know they can only be reached once you have access to a hacking device already.
游戏中还有其他几种黑客设备，但据我所知，只有在你已经拥有黑客设备后才能接触到它们。
Other useful items and where to find them
其他实用物品及其获取位置
The yellow screened computer at the police station
警察局里那台黄屏电脑

This one is so special because it is one of a few computers that feature powerful commands to look up information like the location of characters and items.
这台电脑之所以如此特别，是因为它是少数配备强大指令的电脑之一，可以查询角色位置和物品信息等资料。

In its default configuration the computer will let you find the location of yourself or other characters in the game. But after some hackery, you can make it list the items contained in a room or tell you the type of an object. Or list the locations of all items of a kind.
在默认配置下，这台电脑能让你找到自己或其他角色在游戏中的位置。但经过一些破解操作后，你可以让它列出房间内包含的物品、告知你某个对象的类型，或是显示同类别所有物品的位置。
Yout should definately note the name of this machine, as you can access it from other computers and make use of those commands remotely.
你务必记住这台设备的名称，因为可以从其他电脑远程访问它并调用那些命令。






The small computer at the hotel lobby
酒店大堂的小型电脑


This is most probably one of the first computers you came across while playing the game regularly, yet it is a very powerful one. It has the ability to unlock any door in the game if you know what the door is called internally.
这很可能是你常规游戏过程中最早接触到的电脑之一，但它的功能却非常强大。只要你知道游戏中某扇门的内部名称，它就有能力解锁任何门禁。
This is useful in the computer's default configuration when you enter those names while in the hotel lobby, but it gets really powerful once you start accessing this command remotely.
这在电脑的默认配置下很有用，当你在酒店大堂输入这些名称时就能生效，但当你开始远程访问这个命令时，它的威力才真正显现出来。


The extractor
提取器




The extractor does exactly that: it extracts useful information from anything you point it at. Most notably it will read out an object's name in its default configuration.
提取器的功能正是如此：它能从你指定的任何对象中提取有用信息。最显著的功能是读取对象在默认配置下的名称。
This is usefull for code (when connecting to things) or when looking up information (e.g. at the yellow screened computer in the police station).
这在连接设备时处理代码，或查询信息时（例如在警察局的黄屏电脑上操作）特别实用。
It also features a handy command to put something to the clipboard, so usually the first thing I do when I find an extractor is to hack it so it runs "CopyToClipboard(name)" in addition to just saying the name.
它还有一个方便的命令，可以将内容复制到剪贴板，所以我找到提取器后的第一件事通常是入侵它，让它除了报出名称外还执行"CopyToClipboard(name)"命令。

One of the first extractors in the game is found on top of a tall computer in the small alcove in the hotel basement. To unlock the door to the basement, hack the computer at the reception.
游戏中的第一个提取器位于酒店地下室小隔间的高大电脑顶部。要解锁地下室的门，需要入侵前台的电脑。
Down in the comments at the bottom it will mention several doors that can be unlocked, so just memorize the name or write it down (you cannot paste into prompts on a running computer unfortunatly) and then run the computer normally.
在底部的注释中会提到几扇可以解锁的门，只需记住名称或写下来（遗憾的是无法在运行中的电脑提示符里粘贴内容），然后正常操作电脑即可。
Enter "door" as the command instead of entering a guests name and the computer will prompt you for a name. Presto.
输入"door"作为命令（而不是输入客人姓名），电脑就会提示你输入名称。搞定。









The Teleporter
传送装置






There are two easy ways to get a teleporter once you have a hacking device. I'll explain the more complicated way first, as the second one really gives you access to some major story spoilers early on.
当你拥有黑客设备后，有两种简单方式可以获得传送装置。我先说明较复杂的那种方法，因为第二种方式会过早让你接触到重大剧情剧透。

So there are several floppy disks that hint at a teleporting device hidden in a shack by Elsa. Elsa is quite a notable character on her own, but for the teleporter you don't even have to find and talk to her at all.
有几张软盘暗示着艾尔莎在小屋里藏有传送装置。艾尔莎本身就是个相当重要的角色，但若只为获取传送装置，你甚至完全不必寻找并与她交谈。
Just head north twice from the tourist office, crossing a bridge over the rail tracks, to enter the shanty town, a very run down district of Dorisburg. Directly east of the entrance to the area is the shack, but its door is locked.
只需从游客中心向北行进两次，穿过铁轨上方的桥梁，即可进入多里斯堡破败不堪的棚户区。该区域入口正东方向就是那间小屋，但房门是锁着的。
If you don't have an extractor yet, you have to hack a room key to loop possible combinations and then use it on the door to brutefoce your way into it. Otherwise just extract the door's name and head back to the hotel and unlock it from the computer in the lobby.
若你尚未拥有提取器，就必须破解房间钥匙，通过循环尝试所有可能的组合，然后对门使用该钥匙以暴力破解进入。否则，只需提取门的名称并返回酒店，在大厅的电脑上将其解锁。
The code for the bruteforcing key is really simple:
暴力破解钥匙的代码非常简单：
loop from 1 to 9999
  Unlock(@)
end
从 1 循环至 9999
  解锁(@)
结束
The "at"-sign is a shorthand to access the loop's counter, which is passed to the key's Unlock() command. Once you have the code in place and right click a door while holding the key in your hands, it will try every combination up to 9999 until it finds the correct one.
"@"符号是访问循环计数器的快捷方式，该计数器会被传递给钥匙的 Unlock()命令。当你放置好代码并手持钥匙右键点击门时，它会尝试所有直到 9999 的组合，直到找到正确的那组。
This doesn't take long. On the other hand, you could spend the extra minute and grab the key from Elsa's lair on the fourth floor of the tower building just across from the shack and use that to open the locked door.
这并不会花费太长时间。另一方面，你也可以多花一分钟，从塔楼四层艾尔莎巢穴中取得钥匙——塔楼就在小屋正对面——用那把钥匙打开上锁的门。

In the second room of the shack you will find the teleporter.
在小屋的第二个房间，你会找到传送装置。

The other easy way to get a teleporter is to go to the hotel's server basement as described in the section about the extractor above. In the same area you will find a large computer with a pink screen on the large wall of the basement. Use it and chose option 3 to "slurp".
获取传送器的另一种简单方法是前往酒店的服务器地下室，具体位置可参考上文关于提取器的说明。在地下室那面巨大的墙壁上，你会看到一台粉色屏幕的大型电脑。使用它并选择第 3 个选项"吸取"。
This will let you travel the internet to a "CentralServer", which is located in a testing area.
这将使你通过互联网前往位于测试区域的"中央服务器"。

This testing area contains lots of items! Most notably two teleporters and two hacking devices. If you inspect the computers in this room, you will find connections to really late or even end game terminals.
这个测试区域包含大量物品！最引人注目的是两台传送器和两台黑客设备。如果检查这个房间里的电脑，你会发现通往游戏后期甚至终局终端的连接。

Teleporters allow you to display your current position in a room and warp you to other places, if you can provide the room name and some coordinates.
传送器可以显示你在房间中的当前位置，并能将你传送到其他地方——前提是你能提供房间名称和若干坐标。
If your coordinates happen to lay outside of the walkable space of a map when you teleport there, just start clicking somewhere inside the room to make Sebastian warp to a legal spot inside the room automatically.
若传送时你的坐标恰好位于地图可行走区域之外，只需在房间内任意位置点击，塞巴斯蒂安便会自动瞬移至房间内的合法位置。
I advise you to keep notes for possible locations right inside the teleporter itself, so you can quickly uncomment them or paste them into a "SetWorldPosition()" call.
建议你直接在传送装置内部记录可能的坐标位置，这样就能快速取消注释或将其粘贴到"SetWorldPosition()"调用中。




























Get a second hacking device
获取第二台黑客设备




A hacking device cannot hack itself, but you can hack another hacking device. The code of a hack dev contains a function that controls the access level. To enable the full power of the device, this function should always return true, regardless of the level.
黑客设备无法对自身进行破解，但可以破解另一台黑客设备。黑客设备的代码中包含控制访问权限的函数。要释放设备的全部潜能，该函数应始终返回 true，无论权限等级如何。
There are several ways to do this, for example you could literally have it say "return true", or change "return level == 0" to "return level >= 0" or "return level == level".
有多种方法可以实现这一点，例如你可以直接让它显示"return true"，或者将"return level == 0"改为"return level >= 0"或"return level == level"。

Notice that the function also gets the name of the object to be hacked as a parameter, so you can put it to the clipboard if you connect to your extractor or even make your hack dev unlock doors while hacking them by connecting to the computer in the hotel lobby and invoking its Unlock() command right from within the hack dev for example.
注意该函数还会获取待破解对象的名称作为参数，因此如果你连接到提取器，甚至可以在破解时让黑客设备直接解锁门禁——比如通过连接酒店大堂的电脑，直接在黑客设备中调用其 Unlock()命令。

You can find several additional hacking devices all over town, but you will most likely run into the one in the Lodge, where Pixie and the other guys of the underground resistance meet.
你可以在城镇各处找到多个额外的黑客设备，但最有可能在洛奇旅馆遇到其中一台，那里是皮克茜和其他地下抵抗组织成员会面的地方。
With an upgraded and enhanced hacking device, getting through the locked door in the shoe store's basement will be a piece of cake.
使用升级强化后的黑客设备，突破鞋店地下室的锁闭门禁简直易如反掌。






Taste your special brew
品尝你的特调饮品







Hacking drinks plays a great role in this game and beverages have access to the powerful "Connect()" command and can execute remote procedures. This makes drinks one of the most versatile items in the game, easy to acquire and powerful in their range of effects.
在本游戏中，调制饮品扮演着重要角色，各类饮料都能使用强大的"Connect()"指令并执行远程程序。这使得饮品成为游戏中最多功能化的物品之一，不仅易于获取，其效果范围也极具威力。

But before we get down to breaking the game by abusing drinks of any type, let's inspect the soda machines first. And by inspecting I mean hacking of course!
不过在开始通过滥用各类饮品破坏游戏平衡之前，让我们先来检查自动售货机。所谓的检查，当然就是指破解！

The "CreateDrink()" command takes two arguments: the type of beverage you want and the amount of liquid to be contained in a can.
"CreateDrink()"指令需要两个参数：你想要的饮料类型，以及每罐所含的液体容量。
So essentially you can have a soda machine dispense coffee or even fancy longdrinks if you like and make them last longer by having them as bigas you like, for example 1000 instead of 100.
也就是说，你可以让汽水机提供咖啡甚至花式长饮，并且通过随意调整容量来延长饮用时间——比如将默认的 100 单位改成 1000 单位。

Each time you take a sip from a drink, it will run the drink's code. If you drink a coffee, it will call "Seleepiness(-25)" for example. So you will be 25 units less sleepy and the drink will use up 25% of its contents.
每次饮用时，系统都会执行饮品的程序代码。以咖啡为例，饮用后会触发"睡意值(-25)"效果，这意味着你的睡意值将降低 25 个单位，同时饮品会消耗 25%的内容物。
But the 25 are only 25% if the can's maximum amount of liquid is 100!
但请注意：这 25%的消耗量仅适用于容量为 100 单位的罐装饮品！
If you change the amount to 1000, the first sip of coffee will lower the remaining amount of the can from "1000%" to "975%".
若将容量调整为 1000 单位，喝第一口咖啡后，罐内剩余量会从"1000%"变为"975%"。

What does that matter? Well, it means that a normal can can get you a max value of "Sleepiness(-100)" before it is empty. Well, you can have the code read "Sleepiness(-200)" if you like, but if the max amount of liquid is 100, your benefit will be just 100 as well.
这有什么关系呢？这意味着一罐普通饮料在喝完前最多能提供"困倦度(-100)"的效果。当然，你也可以把代码写成"困倦度(-200)"，但如果液体最大容量是 100，你实际获得的收益也只有 100。
Given a can of "1000%" coffe, the same code will net you the expected 200 units of... awakeness...
假设有一罐"1000%"浓度的咖啡，同样的代码将为你带来预期的 200 单位...清醒值...
and lower the remaining amount of coffee to "800%".
同时将剩余的咖啡含量降至"800%"。

This is a good start! But can we do more? You bet we can!
这是个不错的开始！但我们还能做得更好吗？当然可以！

See those other commands? "Charisma()", "Corruption()", "Smelliness()", "Speed()"? They each control one of the drinker's attributes. So in addition to keep you awake, you can have your drinks keep you charismatic, running faster and smelling good as well!
看到其他那些指令了吗？"魅力()"、"腐化()"、"体味()"、"速度()"？它们分别控制着饮酒者的某项属性。所以除了保持清醒之外，你还可以让饮品使你魅力四射、跑得更快，甚至还能让你闻起来香喷喷的！
It doesn't matter at all on yourself, but watch what happens to Frank while you take your test to gain a membership in the revolution gang down in the Lodge.
这对你本人毫无影响，但当你参加革命帮派入会测试时，注意观察弗兰克身上发生的变化。

Smelliness happens to you while you drink booze or sleep without a proper bed and Corruption is what happens to you while you stay on the internet.
饮用烈酒或在不合适的床铺上睡觉会导致体味值上升，而长时间泡在互联网上则会积累腐化值。
The more time you spend there, the funkier Sebastian will look like, with parts of his body showing strange colors or even a whole box of colors appearing around him after a while. This is also what has happened to Ivan when the ministry ran its experiment.
你在网上停留的时间越久，塞巴斯蒂安的外表就会变得越怪异——身体部位会显现出奇怪的颜色，过段时间甚至会出现整盒颜料环绕周身的景象。这正是当初部门进行实验时发生在伊万身上的情况。

When you have a drink call "Corruption()" with negative numbers as its argument, your corruption level (or better yet: the corruption level of the person having the drink) is lowered, up until it all gets back to normal.
当你饮用名为"腐败()"的饮料并传入负数参数时，你的腐败等级（更准确地说：是饮用者的腐败等级）将会降低，直至完全恢复正常。

This part is probably the most troublesome in regards to how you can alter the game. Again: Don't read the rest of this if you are on your first playthrough!
这部分内容可能是游戏机制中最容易引发争议的改动环节。再次提醒：若是初次体验游戏，请勿继续阅读后续内容！

Great, so your drink can have all of those status changes at once. But it will rapidly drain the can!
太棒了，现在你的饮料可以同时触发所有状态变化。但这会快速消耗罐中饮料！

Sinks to the rescue! Your soda can is able to connect to other objects in the world. Extract the name of a water tap or have the police computer list all items within a room to find a suitable name. but before you connect to one, have a look at a sink's code first.
洗手间水槽前来救场！你的汽水罐能够与场景中的其他物体建立连接。可以通过提取水龙头名称，或让警用电脑列出房间内所有物品来寻找合适的连接对象。但在建立连接前，请先查看水槽的交互代码。
See those "ClearCode()" and "AppendCode()" commands? You don't want that to happen, as it will overwrite the contents of your drink's code once you connect to it. So delete all of that.
看到那些"ClearCode()"和"AppendCode()"命令了吗？你肯定不希望这些命令执行，因为一旦连接到你的饮料代码，它们就会覆盖其中的内容。所以请把所有这类命令都删掉。
The code of the sink you want to tap (hehe) into should only read like this:
你想要接入（嘿嘿）的水槽代码应该只包含这样的内容：

var Refill(number amount)
    SetLiquidAmount(amount)
end
var Refill(number amount)
    SetLiquidAmount(amount)
结束

Once you took care of that, add this to your can's code:
处理完毕后，将此代码添加至你的罐体程序：

var sink = Connect("Name_of_my_prefered_WaterTap")
sink.Refill(1000)
var sink = Connect("我最喜欢的水龙头名称")
sink.Refill(1000)

You have to replace the name in the connection call of course to reflect the name of the tap that you hacked as instructed above.
你必须将连接调用中的名称替换为你所入侵水龙头的名称，具体操作如上所述。

Now everytime you drink from your can, it will get refilled to 1000, lasting forever!
从现在起，每次饮用罐装饮料时，它都会自动回满至 1000 毫升，永不枯竭！

The fun doesn't stop here, though! Want your drink to control the weather? Connect to the meteorology server and set it to anything you prefer. Want to unlock all doors in the room you are drinking this in?
不过乐趣远不止于此！想让饮料控制天气吗？连接气象服务器并设置成你喜欢的任何天气。想解锁当前饮用房间的所有门禁？
Connect to the police computer, determine the name of your room and then connect to the computer in the hotel to unlock every door you encounter while you have the police computer cycle through all objects in the room.
只需连接警用电脑，确定所在房间名称后，再连接酒店电脑系统。当警用电脑循环扫描房间内所有对象时，你遇到的每扇门都将自动解锁。
Wonder why the quicktravel command through the internet is called "Slurp()"? Connect to anywhere from your can and call "Slurp()" it to see why.
想知道为什么通过互联网的快速传送指令被称为"Slurp()"吗？从你的罐头连接至任意地点，调用"Slurp()"指令就能明白其中奥妙。

The most abundant item yields the greatest power.
最丰富的物品蕴含着最强大的力量。

And as a soda salesman, you can even enhance all drinks by altering the code before you hand them out to the unsuspecting buyer :)
作为一名汽水销售员，你甚至可以在将饮料交给毫无戒心的买家之前，通过修改代码来增强所有饮品的功效 :)







































































(EHB)²: Else Heart.Break() Elite Hacker Board
(EHB)²：《Else Heart.Break()》精英黑客论坛
Another serious word of advice: don't peek this chapter unless you finished the game once or twice yourself! With the info in this section you will gain almost unlimited powers in the game.
另一个严肃的建议：除非你已经自己通关过一两次游戏，否则不要偷看本章内容！通过本节信息，你将在游戏中获得近乎无限的力量。





A hacker's ultimate tool of trade.
黑客的终极交易工具。
If you ever wondered how you could possibly unleash your cyber powers with items that only allow one button to push (or wheel to turn) and hate having to screwdriver floppy functionality to each computer you come across and hack it to run your mighty boot floppy code with a bit of collected code snippets, this thing will seem like the final answer.
如果你曾困惑于如何用仅有一个按钮（或旋钮）的设备释放网络能力，又厌倦了每遇到一台电脑就要用螺丝刀改装软驱功能，再通过收集的代码片段运行强大的启动盘程序——那么这件物品就是终极答案。
Would you like to summon a screen floating in mid air and running code to empower Sebastian like Neo after takeing a full night of VR instruction experiences? Then this is just what you were waiting for.
是否想召唤悬浮在空中的屏幕运行代码，让塞巴斯蒂安像经历整夜 VR 训练后的尼奥那样获得强化？这正是你期待已久的东西。

I was testing a bunch of computers to call up to where ever I was, but none looked right. Or they were too small in size. Then I saw a video of Pudding Muffin in which he used the Playstation from Longson's apartment just like what I described above.
我测试了好几台电脑，想召唤到我的所在地，但看起来都不对劲。要么就是尺寸太小了。后来我看到了布丁玛芬的视频，他用的正是龙森公寓里的 Playstation，完全符合我之前的描述。
This was it, the final proof for me that you could rule Dorisburg in style like Hiro Protagonist ruled the Metaverse in Neal Stephenson's cyberpunk bestseller novel 'Snow Crash'. And you don't even have to make a fool out of yourself by turning into a lametta!
这就是最终证据——你完全可以像尼尔·斯蒂芬森赛博朋克畅销小说《雪崩》中主角广主宰元宇宙那样，潇洒地统治多里斯堡。而且你根本不必像挂满装饰条的圣诞树那样出洋相！

Other than the cool looks, the Playstation is a good choice because of its broad support of commands right from the start. But if you prefer to switch to another rig, use a screwdriver to enable all API's and swap 'LongsonPlaystation' with the name of your object of choice.
除了酷炫的外观，Playstation 还有个优势是初始就支持大量指令。但如果你偏好其他设备，可以用螺丝刀启用所有 API，再把"LongsonPlaystation"替换成你心仪对象的名称。

OK, let's get down to the real treat. Head over to my Github project for EHB[github.com] to get the code. You can either download everything as a zip file, clone it with git or just copy the code right from the webpage.
好了，现在来点真正的干货。请访问我的 GitHub 项目 EHB[github.com]获取代码。你可以下载整份压缩包，用 git 克隆仓库，或者直接从网页上复制代码。

To use it in the game, follow these simple steps:
要在游戏中使用它，请遵循以下简单步骤：
Copy the contents of 'SummonHackerBoard.sprak' into the item you want to use to summon or dismiss the Hacker Board with. Could be a mystical cube, a radio or pretty much anything Sebastian can use.
将 'SummonHackerBoard.sprak' 文件内容复制到你想要用来召唤或解散黑客滑板的物品中。可以是一个神秘立方体、收音机，或者塞巴斯蒂安能使用的几乎任何物品。
I prefer to put this into the CheckBalance() function of my creditcard, because I can have it ready in my hand without having to fear losing it by accidentally letting go of the right mouse button over a trash can while turning the camera.
我倾向于将其放入信用卡的 CheckBalance() 函数中，因为这样可以随时握在手中，不必担心在转动视角时因意外松开鼠标右键而将其丢进垃圾桶。
And you don't have to bring any special items as you will most likely never throw away your creditcard. On the other hand, you will need a souped up modifier that is able to hack into objects of higher security levels.
而且你无需携带任何特殊物品，因为你几乎永远不会丢弃自己的信用卡。不过另一方面，你需要一个强化过的修改器，能够入侵更高安全等级的对象。
With the first part of the code in place, you can now pull up the board anywhere in the game. If the board is already present in your area and you use your selected item again, the board will vanish. Call the board now.
随着代码的第一部分就位，你现在可以在游戏任意位置调出控制面板。若当前区域已存在控制面板且你再次使用选定的物品，面板将会消失。现在请召唤控制面板。
It's not really a Hacker Board right now, it is just running the usual Playstation code. We will change that now!
目前这还算不上真正的黑客控制面板，它只是运行着常规的 Playstation 代码。我们现在就来改变这个状况！
Hack the Playstation and overwrite its code with the one from 'EliteHackerBoard.sprak'. The original functionality will still be available from the Hacker Board, if you enter the command 'playstation'.
请破解 Playstation 系统，用'EliteHackerBoard.sprak'中的代码覆盖原有程序。原始功能仍可通过黑客控制面板使用，只需输入'playstation'指令即可调用。
To use the Hacker Board, there is nothing else to do after those three steps. But I recommend to check out the 'help' command, check out the default configuration with 'get all' and maybe tweak at least the lastlistaddr setting once with 'set lastlistaddr 1000' to have it saved in the playstation's memory. Also, have a look at the README.md file to get some more tips and examples to get up to speed with the Elite Hacker Board.
完成这三个步骤后即可正常使用黑客控制面板。不过我建议你查看'help'指令说明，通过'get all'查看默认配置，并至少使用'set lastlistaddr 1000'调整一次最后列表地址设置以保存至 Playstation 内存。同时不妨查阅 README.md 文件获取更多技巧和实例，助你快速掌握精英黑客控制面板的使用。

Now, what would you like to use your new power for? Maybe get yourself a taser like the typers have? Enter 'all type taser' to get a list of all tasers in the game. If you want to know where any of these can be found, use 'find !0' to get the position of the first item in the list you just saw. Likewise, 'find !1' will do the same for the second item on the list. So the numbers match the ones in the list output and they are zero based indexes. Say you want to get the second taser after checking its coordinates. You could try several things now: 'slurp !1' will let you slurp to the item if possible, while 'slurp @' will let you travel to the room the item is in. The at-sign is a shortcut for the last room just like '!#' refers to a numbered item from the last list. You could also do it the other way around and transport the taser to your feet by typing the command 'move !1 LongsonPlaystation'.
现在，你打算用这份新获得的力量做些什么呢？要不要像打字员们那样给自己弄个电击枪？输入"all type taser"即可查看游戏中所有电击枪的列表。若想了解其中任意物品的获取位置，使用"find !0"就能获取刚才所见列表中首个物品的坐标。同理，"find !1"将对应列表中的第二个物品。这些数字与列表输出中的序号完全对应，且采用从零开始的索引。假设在查看坐标后你想获取第二把电击枪，现在可以尝试多种操作："slurp !1"会尝试直接将物品传送到你手中（若可行），而"slurp @"则会带你前往物品所在的房间。@符号是最近访问房间的快捷指令，正如"!#"代表最近列表中的编号物品。你还可以反其道而行，通过输入指令"move !1 LongsonPlaystation"将电击枪传送到你脚下。

But let me tell you this: you won't need a taser as long as you have your board ready. You can even zap anyone anywhere in the game, without needing to get up close and personal! Say you are in your hotel room, using your Board.
不过我要告诉你：只要备好你的控制板，根本不需要什么电击枪。你甚至能隔空电击游戏里的任何人，完全无需近身接触！假设你正待在酒店房间里使用控制板。
And you want to finally have the police officer that never sleeps take a nap.
而你终于想让那位永不眠的警官打个盹了。
You can do so by entering 'zap Police'. Don't believe me? You could query 'action Police' to see that she is doing nothing, but if that is not proof enough, 'slurp @' to quick travel there and see with your own eyes.
你可以通过输入“zap Police”来实现。不相信吗？你可以查询“action Police”来确认她确实无所事事，如果这还不够有说服力，那就输入“slurp @”快速传送过去亲眼看看吧。

If you want to get a list of all items in a room, it will be available as 'all room Hotel_Room1' (if you are interested in your hotel room) or 'all room @' to get a list of all items in the room of your last query. Or 'all room here' to get a list of all items in your current area.
如果想获取房间内所有物品的清单，可以输入“all room Hotel_Room1”（如果你对酒店房间感兴趣），或者输入“all room @”来获取你上次查询房间的物品清单。亦或是输入“all room here”来获取当前区域的所有物品列表。

Want to know which type an item is? You can do that for just one item with the list expansion you already know: 'type !0' for the first item on your list. Or you could get the type of every item on a list if you do a 'list type' instead. You can see the result by entering 'list show' or just 'show' for short.
想知道某个物品属于什么类型？你可以用已经熟悉的列表扩展功能查看单个物品：“type !0”用于查看列表中第一个物品的类型。或者，你可以通过输入“list type”来获取列表中每个物品的类型。输入“list show”或简写“show”即可查看结果。

You see, using the Elite Hacker Board is easy, but you can accomplish a lot by just using one simple item to summon it. Just like the normal game: play around, study the code, modify it to suit your needs and add features. Got the sound effects working?
要知道，使用精英黑客主板其实很简单，只需使用一件简单的物品就能召唤它。就像普通游戏一样：随意探索、研究代码、按需修改并添加功能。音效搞定了吗？
Implemented a text filter for lists? Did any other cool thing with this?
为列表实现了文本筛选器？还用这个做了什么其他酷炫的功能吗？

Some fun things you might have missed on your playthrough.
一些你在游玩过程中可能错过的有趣内容。

How many cabins does the ship have?
这艘船有多少个船舱？

Once you can unlock any door you encounter, get back onto the ship you arrived on and unlock every door there. Where will they take you? :)
一旦你能解锁遇到的任何门，就回到你抵达时乘坐的船上，打开那里的每一扇门。它们会带你前往何处呢？:)


The (not so) Secret Arcade
（不那么）秘密街机厅

You can find several hints about the Secret Arcade on various floppy disks and computers. But once you get there, the place is more dull than its name implied.
你可以在各种软盘和电脑上找到关于秘密游戏厅的线索。但当你真正抵达那里时，这个地方比其名字暗示的要乏味得多。
It has only one arcade cabinet, a graphical floppy disk reader, some small computers and a sink you can use without risking any NPC to stumble in and use it.
这里仅有一台街机柜、一个图形化软盘读取器、几台小型电脑，以及一个你可以放心使用的水槽——完全不必担心会有 NPC 闯进来使用它。



The dreamworld
梦境世界

Just like the Secret Arcade, you can come across disks that refer to Ratvader and RatvadersDreamEntrance. If you warp there, you are treated with a lush green scenery where you can relax and enjoy some nice music without anyone ever disturbing you.
就像秘密游戏厅那样，你可能会发现提及"鼠群入侵者"和"鼠群入侵者梦境入口"的磁盘。若你传送至此，将置身于郁郁葱葱的绿色景致中，这里无人打扰，你可以放松身心，享受美妙音乐。
Although some disks mention you should visit at night to meet other folks, but Ratvader has already transcended to the next world it seems.
虽然有些光盘提到你应该在夜间拜访以遇见其他人，但鼠侠似乎已经超脱到另一个世界了。



Hidden message at Pixie's
皮克西家中的隐藏信息

Did you notice the large walkable wardrobe in the lower section of Pixie's Apartment? Did you also notice the disk with her diary?
你注意到皮克西公寓下层那个可步入式大衣柜了吗？是否也发现了记录她日记的光盘？

Also: did you notice the hidden message written to the back of the cupboard besides her bed? It's the same URL as the graffiti in one of the cells at the police station...
另外：你留意到她床边橱柜背面写的隐藏信息了吗？那串网址和警察局某个拘留室墙上的涂鸦完全相同……




Felix' miracle box
菲利克斯的神奇盒子

Did you notice that apart from arcade cabinets, Felix' computer below the staircase to his sleeping area is the only one computer in the game that displays a graphical animation? Because of that I like to think of him as a member of the Demo Scene :)
你是否注意到，除了街机游戏机之外，菲利克斯位于睡眠区楼梯下方的电脑是游戏中唯一显示图形动画的电脑？正因如此，我喜欢将他视为演示场景的一员 :)

He also has an arcade cabinet in his flat that comes with an added benefit. Did you notice the pipe connecting to the arcade? Inspect the tap on top of it - parties at his place will never run out of booze for sure!
他的公寓里还有一台街机游戏机，附带一个额外好处。你注意到连接街机的管道了吗？检查顶部的龙头——在他家举办的派对绝对永远不会缺酒喝！




Inventory space
背包空间

Did you know a character's inventory space is actually a room as far as the game is concerned? Just append "_inventory" to a character name and have the police computer list the items in the room to get to know the names of items even without having an extractor.
你知道吗？在游戏系统看来，角色的背包空间其实就是一个房间？只需在角色名后加上"_inventory"，然后让警用电脑列出房间内的物品，即使没有提取器也能知道物品名称。
Or get to know your extractor's name.
或者直接问问你的提取器叫什么名字。

You cannot teleport to inventories though. But you can inspect other people's posessions and even exchange items.
不过你无法直接传送至背包空间。但可以查看他人的随身物品，甚至进行物品交换。






The inaccessible cupboard
那个无法打开的储物柜

The large computer in the hotel's basement with the pink screen will let you slurp to the CentralServer in a Testing environment. One of the other computers there will let you even travel to another testing area, called the beer room on the machine.
If you explore the list of rooms the police computer gets you, you can find other testing areas as well. There is also a tiny rooftop hideout across from the hotel that you can get to by slurping to "Lowenbrau", a floppy disk of that name is hidden there.

But this section is about one of the cupboards in the original testing area. Did you notice you can put items in it? Did you also notice you cannot access its contents? Well, you can, but you have to use the police computer again!
The cupboard is listed as a room and you can have the computer list its contents as well as transfer them to your inventory with the SetPosition() function.
Just put the item's name as the first parameter and "Sebastian_inventory" as the second argument and you can retrieve anything that is hidden in there. I guess Eric never got around to implement proper storage handling for containers like that or he decided against their use.
The few suitcases that can be found are an indication for this.












Speaking of suitcases...
说到行李箱...




Did you find the suitcases that can enhance your inventory space? There is one in hotel room 3 for example, or in Pixie's apartment. You can also find one while doing the Radio tower sidequest or when exploring the ministry.
你找到那些能扩展背包空间的行李箱了吗？比如酒店 3 号房间里有一个，皮克西的公寓里也有。在做无线电塔支线任务或探索政府部门时也能找到一个。

You can put suitcases in your bag and they will show up as additional inventory space for you to open like your bag. The suitcase in the radio station for example contains a disk with valuable info.
你可以将手提箱放入背包，它们会显示为额外的存储空间，供你像打开背包一样开启。例如，广播站里的手提箱装有一张载有珍贵信息的光盘。
But to put something into a suitcase you have to drop the case to the floor, then take the item you want to place there in your hands, then right click the suitcase and pick it up again and put it back into you bag. Way too complicated to be useful in my opinion
但要想往手提箱里存放物品，你必须先将箱子扔到地上，然后手持想要存放的物品，右键点击手提箱，再将其拾起放回背包。在我看来，这套操作过于繁琐，实用性大打折扣



Elsa's hidden hideout
艾尔莎的秘密藏身处






Did you find Elsa on your own? Did you also find here little hideout on the roof? This one is easy to miss. Elsa lives in the tallest building in the shanty town all the way to the north from the tourist info.
你是自己发现艾尔莎的吗？是否也找到了她位于屋顶的小小藏身处？这个地方很容易被忽略。艾尔莎住在棚户区最高的那栋建筑里，从旅游信息中心一路往北走就能找到。
The different floors of the tower can be reached by the elevator inside, or can they? Hack the elevator panel inside to reveal that the buttons 2 and 3 both go to floor 2, which is the third floor.
塔楼的不同楼层可以通过内部的电梯到达，或者说真的可以吗？黑入电梯内部的控制面板会发现，按钮 2 和 3 都指向 2 楼，而这里实际上是第三层。
Change the code to get to floor 1 whenever you press 2 to get to a whole hidden floor of the building with an exit to the rooftop with more of Elsa's equipment.
修改代码，使得按下按钮 2 时总能抵达 1 楼，这样就能进入建筑中完全隐藏的楼层，那里有通往天台的出口，还能找到更多艾尔莎的装备。
If you feel inclined to keep her secret, have the elevator only go to floor 1 if Sebastian is using it ;)
如果你有意替她保守秘密，可以设置成只有当塞巴斯蒂安使用电梯时，按下按钮 2 才会前往 1 楼 ;)

Btw: the numbering of the floors is odd here: Elsa refers to her lair (where you find the shack key and where she spends most of the time indoors) as being on the fourth floor, and you get there by pushing the 4 on the panel in the elevator.
顺便一提：这里的楼层编号有些奇怪：艾尔莎将她的秘密基地（也就是你能找到棚屋钥匙、且她大部分时间待在室内的地方）称为四楼，而你需要按下电梯面板上的 4 号按钮才能到达那里。
Yet the hidden floor 1 at number 2 leads to the rooftop, so it should be the higher one...
然而，2 号楼的隐藏一层通向屋顶，所以应该是更高那层...







The free apartment
免费公寓

Did you notice that the building to the west of the hotel has an empty apartment on the lower floor? If you enter the building from the south you can access it without a locked door in your way.
你注意到酒店西侧那栋楼的低层有间空公寓吗？如果从南侧进入大楼，你可以直接进入，没有上锁的门挡路。
Inside you will find a bed, a floppy disk reader and key to open the locked door that leads to the lobby of the house with the two big entrances that lead to the hotel exterior.
在公寓里你会发现一张床、一个软盘读取器，以及能打开那扇上锁房门的钥匙——那扇门通向带有两扇大型出入口的住宅大厅，这两个出口都通往酒店外部。
It's a nice alternative to the hotel if you want to buy the hacking device from the north harbor and don't like to stretch out your credit card by paying the fee the hotel demands.
如果你想从北港购买黑客设备，又不想因支付酒店要求的费用而透支信用卡，这是个不错的替代选择。





Ivan's highscore
伊凡的最高分

Did you notice that Ivan holds the highscore on the arcade in Bar Yvonne? Setting a record yourself seems difficult until you gain the ability to hack the cabinet....
你注意到伊凡在伊冯娜酒吧的街机上保持着最高分记录吗？在获得破解游戏机的能力之前，自己创造记录似乎很困难……

The biggest testing area
最大的测试区域


Most players will stumble upon the testing area you can travel to from one of the computers in the basement of the hotel. But did you check out NickeRoom? That is the biggest hidden area with the most items in it.
大多数玩家都会偶然发现那个可以从酒店地下室的某台电脑前往的测试区域。但你们探索过尼克房间吗？那可是隐藏最深、物品最丰富的秘密区域。
You can see about any computer type, any door, drinks and other stuff. It even has blank credit cards and a taser. And the big cannon that they used to beam Ivan into the matrix. Hey, we are waist deep in the spoiler swamp here, it's OK!
你能看到各种类型的电脑、各式门扉、饮料和其他物品。那里甚至有空白的信用卡和电击枪。还有他们用来把伊万传送进矩阵的那门巨型炮。嘿，我们现在可是深陷剧透沼泽了，不过没关系！


Poor Bob/h1]
可怜的鲍勃/h1]

You can find Bob's creditcard at the financial computer, but you'll be unable to give it back to poor Bob. Really, he has no inventory to put it anyways, so you're even unable to sneak the card back to him!
你可以在财务电脑处找到鲍勃的信用卡，但无法将它归还给可怜的鲍勃。说真的，他根本没有背包来存放物品，所以你连偷偷把卡塞回给他都做不到！


Highly experimental
极具实验性



Did you know there are only 4 teleporters in this game and that only one of them is in a regular room while the other three are found in testing areas?
你是否知道游戏中仅有 4 个传送装置，其中只有一个位于常规房间，另外三个都藏在测试区域？

If you want to have one as soon as possible, here is probably the quickest way:
若想尽快获得传送装置，这或许是最快捷的途径：

Once you get off the boat, head north to the next area (possibly buying a modifier for $100 while you are here) and over the bridge to yet another area to the north. Enter the tower there, with the long narrow hallway that leads to an elevator and ride it to the top floor.
下船后向北进入下一个区域（可在此处花费 100 美元购买改造模块），穿过桥梁继续北行抵达另一区域。进入矗立着狭长走廊的高塔，走廊尽头电梯会将你送至顶层。
Enter the room to the left of the elevator exit and grab the key from the bookshelf. Exit the tower and use the key to open the door to the east of the south exit of the area.
进入电梯出口左侧的房间，从书架上取得钥匙。离开塔楼后，用这把钥匙开启区域南出口东侧的门。
The teleporter is in the second room.
传送器位于第二个房间内。

@smHatter a sink operates on the last drink that was used on it, not on the drink that connects to it. same with the stove and probably some other items.
@smHatter 水槽的运行机制基于最后一次使用的饮品，而非与其连接的饮品。炉灶及其他部分物品的运行逻辑与此相同。

@Gl'bgolyb: SetPosition, GetRoom etc. are part of the "TingrunnerAPI", which you can't set via the screwdriver. the only computers in the game with the "TingrunnerAPI" are:
@Gl'bgolyb：SetPosition、GetRoom 等功能属于"TingrunnerAPI"组件，无法通过螺丝刀进行设置。游戏中唯一搭载"TingrunnerAPI"的计算机设备包括：

- Heart
- 心脏
- LongsonPlaystation
- MainFrame
- 主框架
- PoliceOfficeInterior_MinistryOfficeWorkstationComputer_1

There are two code snippets involved in the infinite beverage trick. First you need to change the code of the sink, then alter the code of the drink, like I described in the chapter "Taste your special brew". First snippet to the sink, second one to the drink object.
无限饮料技巧涉及两段代码。首先你需要修改水槽的代码，然后按照我在"品尝你的特调饮品"章节中描述的那样修改饮料的代码。第一段代码用于水槽，第二段用于饮料对象。
Sinks usually overwrite the code of the connected script, so you have to replace it by something useful instead of destructive.
水槽通常会覆盖连接脚本的代码，所以你必须用有用的代码替换它，而不是破坏性的代码。

Ok, so using the drink on the sink fixed it.
好的，对水槽使用饮料就解决了问题。

I can't get the refilling drink to work. Doesn't matter where I put it, the drink doesn't refill.
我无法让自动续杯饮料机正常工作。无论我把它放在哪里，饮料都不会自动续杯。
Connecting to: var sink= Connect("Hotel_Bathroom_Poor_WaterTap_Poor_WaterTap_1")
正在连接：var sink= Connect("Hotel_Bathroom_Poor_WaterTap_Poor_WaterTap_1")

I admit I don't know the answer. All I ever really used the screwdriver for was to enable floppy and internet, the rest was pulled in from the code on my disk from other machines. Oh, and of course tweaking the speed of arcades...
我承认我不知道答案。我真正使用螺丝刀的功能只是启用软盘和互联网，其余的都是通过我磁盘上的代码从其他机器拉取过来的。哦，当然还有调整街机游戏的速度...

About your EHB, I noticed something odd you pointed out- you mentioned using a screwdriver to add all APIs to another computer and just using it instead of LongsonPlaystation... is it possible to add SetPostion, GetRoom, and whatnot with the Screwdriver?
关于你的 EHB，我注意到你指出的一个奇怪之处——你提到用螺丝刀把所有 API 添加到另一台电脑上，然后直接使用它而不是龙芯游戏站...是否有可能用螺丝刀添加 SetPostion、GetRoom 之类的功能呢？
If so, what's the name of that API?
如果是这样，那个 API 叫什么名字？
