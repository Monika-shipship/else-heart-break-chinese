Introduction
引言
First of all: else Heart.Break() is a very spoiler-sensitive game. It's a game about being curious and playful, about finding mystery and solving it. For that reason it is imperative that you avoid spoilers for as long as possible. Play the game yourself first.
首先需要明确：《else Heart.Break()》是一款极易被剧透破坏体验的游戏。它本质上关于保持好奇与玩乐之心，关于发现谜题并亲手解开。因此请务必尽可能避免接触剧透内容，务必先亲自体验游戏。


I have played many hacking games, but else Heart.Break() is the most genuine, profound hacking game I have played. It is a hacking game in the true meaning of the work hacking: You are rewarded for being inquisitive, playful and observant. Think outside the box. Realize that the world around you is a system, and that you can interact with that system and even change it in ways that wouldn't be possible in other games.
我玩过许多黑客题材的游戏，但《else Heart.Break()》是我玩过最真实、最深刻的黑客游戏。这是一款真正诠释"黑客精神"的作品：游戏奖励你的求知欲、玩乐心和观察力。跳出思维定式，意识到周遭世界就是一个系统，你可以与这个系统互动，甚至以其他游戏不可能实现的方式改变它。


引用自 "Morpheus"：
This is a sparring program, similar to the programmed reality of the Matrix.
这是个训练程序，类似于矩阵中设计的程序化现实。
It has the same basic rules, rules like gravity. What you must learn is that these
它们遵循相同的基本规则，比如重力规则。你必须明白这些
rules are no different that the rules of a computer system.
规则与计算机系统的规则并无二致。

Some of them can be bent. Others can be broken.
有些可以弯曲，有些可以折断。
The Basics and the Mindset
基础与心态
The first rule of else Heart.Break() is: Find out yourself. Your main task in this game is to find bits of information, piece it together and find out how to use it for your purpose. This has a couple of implications for us.
《else Heart.Break()》的首要法则是：自行探索。你在游戏中的主要任务是搜集信息碎片，将其拼凑整合，并找出如何运用它们达成目标。这对我们而言意味着几点。

引用自 "Rule #1"：
Find out yourself.
自行探索。

Information is power. In Doom you pick up colored keys. In else Heart.Break(), you pick up pieces of information. For example the name of a computer. A snippet of code showing something you didn't think of yourself. The daily routine of a Dorisburg citizen. Everything you know can help you.
信息即是力量。在《毁灭战士》中你收集彩色钥匙，而在《else Heart.Break()》里你收集的是信息碎片。比如某台电脑的名称，一段展现你未曾想到的代码片段，多里斯堡市民的日常作息——你所知晓的一切都可能成为助力。

Information must be acquired. Make a habit simply of finding things out. How does this code work? Experiment. What is the name of this computer? Find a way to find out. And the most important question of all is the meta one: How can I find out how to find out?
信息需要主动获取。请养成探索真相的习惯：这段代码如何运作？动手实验。这台电脑叫什么名字？设法找出答案。而最关键的元问题是：我该如何掌握获取信息的方法？

Information must be stored. You absolutely need a way to store the pieces of information you come across. Whether you use a physical notebook, a text document or speak to a parrot is up to you, as long as you can keep and organize the things you find out. Write lists. Keep a list of player names.
信息必须妥善存储。你绝对需要建立信息归档系统——无论是用实体笔记本、电子文档还是对鹦鹉复述，只要能系统化保存所得情报即可。制作清单：记录玩家名称、
Of sound effects. Of consumables. Of computer names. Of doors. Write down snippets.Store information.
音效档案、消耗品目录、计算机名称合集、门禁编号。摘录代码片段。建立你的信息库。



The second rule of else Heart.Break() is: Break the rules. Just like Neo in The Matrix, you can alter the flow of the world around you to fit your needs. You have probably figured that out yourself (see: Rule #1) by now. However, breaking the rules doesn't just mean to change things. It means to think outside the box.
《else Heart.Break()》的第二条规则是：打破规则。就像《黑客帝国》里的尼奥那样，你可以改变周围世界的运行规律来满足需求。此刻你大概已经自行领悟了这点（参见：规则一）。但打破规则不仅意味着改变事物，更意味着跳出固有思维模式。

Experiment with everything. Ask yourself, "How is this supposed to work?" and then do something completely different. Look for the unobvious approaches. Be creative, playful and don't be afraid to break things.
尝试与所有事物互动。问问自己"这玩意儿本该怎么运作？"然后反其道而行之。寻找那些非显而易见的解决途径。保持创意与玩乐心态，不必担心会搞砸什么。

In fact:Try to break things.
实际上：请试着搞砸点什么。


引用自 "Rule #2"：
Break the rules
打破规则

The extension of this is to see the system as a whole. Don't just change single things, change the ways they work together. Use one thing to change another to change a third. Exploit how one item can do something but another can't.
其延伸在于将系统视为一个整体。不要只改变单个事物，要改变它们协同运作的方式。用一物改变另一物，进而影响第三方。善用某些物品的独有特性——比如某件物品能做到而另一件无法实现的功能。
Tools of the Trade
谋生工具
An important way of making your life in else Heart.Break() easier, is to find a small set of tools that can help you in your daily life. Identify a problem, and then try to find a way to fix it. What's the best way to unlock a door? How can you stay awake?
在《else Heart.Break()》中让生活更轻松的重要方法，是找到一套能在日常生活中协助你的小型工具集。先发现问题，再尝试寻找解决方法：开锁的最佳方式是什么？如何保持清醒？
When going about solving these problems, look at what you have at disposal and identify their key properties and functions. Being portable and having a specific function available is extremely helpful, so look for carryable items with helpful functions.
解决这些问题时，请审视现有资源并识别其关键属性与功能。便携性和特定功能的可用性至关重要，因此要寻找具有实用功能且便于携带的物品。

Some items that help out immensely can be hard to find. Make sure to thoroughly search rooms, especially those that can be harder to get into, to ensure that you don't miss an invaluable tool.
有些极为实用的物品可能难以发现。请务必彻底搜查每个房间，特别是那些较难进入的区域，以免错过无价的道具。
Going Meta
突破次元壁
Learning and using SPRAK is an important aspect of the game. When you are done playing with the world in the game, start playing with the world outside the game. There is another language, called GRIMM, that controls much of how Dorisburgs functions on a day-to-day basis. Start exploring the file structure of the game itself. I recommend, however, that you finish the game at least once before you do so.
学习并运用 SPRAK 语言是游戏的重要环节。当你在游戏世界里探索尽兴后，不妨开始探索游戏之外的天地。还有一种名为 GRIMM 的语言，它掌控着多里斯堡日常运作的诸多机制。不妨开始探索游戏本体的文件结构，不过建议至少先通关一次再尝试。


Another part of the meta is to find replay value in the game. While the world around you is pretty much the same, you can still do different things on a second playthrough. Find the fastest way to find a modifier (without resorting to external help).
另一个突破次元壁的维度在于发掘游戏重复游玩的乐趣。虽然周遭世界大抵相同，但在二周目中你依然能体验截然不同的行动轨迹。试着不借助外部帮助，找出获取修改器的最快捷径。

Try not being (or being) a soda salesman. Again: Experiment, and find clever solutions.
尽量避免（或尝试）成为汽水销售员。再说一遍：多尝试，寻找巧妙的解决方案。
Specific Tips Part 1: Vague Tips
具体技巧第一部分：模糊提示
WARNING: This section contains vague spoilers. Rule #1: Don't read it. Rule #2 (for experts only): Don't read it yet. Remember rule #1 of the game and Find Out Yourself. Only come back here after you've found your own helpful tricks, and then compare them. Getting a solution handed to you ruins the fun. Trust me!
警告：本节包含模糊剧透。规则一：不要阅读。规则二（仅限专家）：暂时不要阅读。牢记游戏第一原则：自行探索。请先找到自己的实用技巧后再回来看这里对比。直接获得解决方案会破坏乐趣。相信我！











Specific Tips Part 2: Serious Spoilers (Don't Read This)
具体技巧第二部分：严重剧透（请勿阅读）







Conclusion
结语
I'd like to sum things up with a great comment by MrMuse:
我想用 MrMuse 的一段精彩评论作为总结：

引用自 "MrMuse"：
My personal feeling if you get stuck is that you have missed clues that the game constantly throws at you. Start over and think about what is initially odd in Dorisberg.
如果你卡关了，我的个人感受是你可能错过了游戏不断向你抛出的线索。重新开始，思考多里斯伯格最初有哪些不寻常之处。
Think about why the game shows you the things it does, how and why people do the things they do - talk to everyone - sometimes repeatedly even if they seem to not be saying much.
思考游戏为何向你展示这些内容，人们做事的动机和方式——与每个人交谈，即使他们看似言之无物，有时也需要反复交流。

else Heart.Break() is a brilliant game if you will let it. Avoid spoilers, pick its mysteries apart on your own and you will have a wonderful adventure. Have fun!
《else Heart.Break()》是款杰出的游戏，只要你愿意接纳它。避开剧透，亲自解开它的谜题，你将会收获一场美妙的冒险。玩得开心！

Also, help? Is there a walkthrough to recommend so that I get the ropes - just at the start!
另外求助！有没有推荐的新手攻略？就想先熟悉下基本操作！
I don't care about being spoiled; the pleasure is gone. I just want to progress to know if I can enjoy this or not at all. (There are no Steam Cloud saves, after all; so I keep losing my progression if I uninstall and retry to get into it later.)
我不在乎剧透；乐趣早已消失。我只想推进进度，看看自己到底能不能享受这款游戏。（毕竟没有 Steam 云存档功能，每次卸载后重装想再尝试时，进度都会丢失。）

Looking around the city myself and seeing how powerful the gameplay is, and the inverstment it requires to understand it...keeps spoiling my motivation. Yeah I'm a little depressed for unrelated reasons, but usually, even like that, I can still enjoy modding a game.
亲自在城里探索时，看到游戏机制的复杂程度以及理解它所需投入的精力...不断消磨着我的动力。没错，我确实因其他原因有些消沉，但即便在这种状态下，通常我仍能享受改装游戏的乐趣。

Taking two hours real time to figure out how to to meet the person who gave me the job, is not what i'm ready to give a game.
花两个小时现实时间去琢磨如何见到给我任务的人，这可不是我愿意为游戏付出的代价。

I've come here to find a walkthrough and am considering watching a let's play but I can see that it's not a kind of game that can beenjoyable that way. It's all through interaction, so I am stuck here as well, lol.
我来这里是为了找攻略，也考虑过看游戏实况，但我发现这类游戏不适合通过这种方式获得乐趣。一切都要通过互动实现，所以我现在也卡在这里了，笑。

Colluplino 2024 年 6 月 11 日 上午 1:08 
Yet, I can understand that it must have been extremely complicated to build this masterpiece... that there is no room to add a tutorial for the non-initiated.
但我能理解，构建这样的杰作必然极其复杂...确实没有余裕为入门玩家添加教程。

Your game is something HUGE...
你的游戏堪称鸿篇巨制...
In fact it is very intimidating.
事实上它令人望而生畏。

(Don't take this like a complain, please, just consider the data. This is like a casual review.)
（请别把这当成抱怨，只是基于数据的客观分享。这更像是一篇随性的体验记录。）

Hello. First of all, wow!
你好。首先，太震撼了！
This game is a giant.
这款游戏堪称鸿篇巨制。

It's the thrid time that I'm installing the game from my library to try to get somewhere with the plot, but it feels like the scenes are crowded and physically too dark for me to see things right.
这已经是我第三次从游戏库中安装这款游戏，试图推进剧情发展，但场景总是显得拥挤不堪，而且画面过于昏暗，让我难以看清细节。
Mh, it's not just the gameplay and my processor's noise, but the graphical atmosphere too, metaphysically speaking...
唔，不仅仅是游戏玩法和我处理器的噪音问题，从形而上的角度来说，连图形氛围也让人感到压抑...

I usually love thinking out of the box and exploring, but I feel overwhelmed by the vibes of this game. I can feel that most of the gameplay lays under the surface just from listening to my hardware while playing it.
我向来喜欢跳出框架思考和探索，但这款游戏的整体氛围让我有些招架不住。光是听着硬件运行的声音，我就能感觉到大部分游戏内容都潜藏在表象之下。

If I had to think 101% like a hacker first to be able play it, I'm not sure that I would be using my computer to just play a game. Not meaning to be rude. I know some real hacking skills, but this game...is a little to wide open for my expectations, lol.
如果必须首先像黑客一样进行 101%的思考才能游玩，我不确定自己会不会专门用电脑来玩这款游戏。并非有意冒犯。我确实掌握一些真正的黑客技术，但这款游戏...对于我的预期来说开放得有些过头了，哈哈。
Regarding similar games, I am used to Hack 'n' Slash, Glitchspace, Data Hacker, and can code.
说到类似的游戏，我玩过《Hack 'n' Slash》《Glitchspace》《Data Hacker》，而且会编程。
But this one seems...feels, like real life work.
但这款游戏给人的感觉...就像是现实中的工作。

Happy new year! So, you've kind of missed some central plot elements, as you've figured out. Namely the Pixie in the club part. For that reason I would suggest starting over, and heading to the club to meet Pixie there.
新年快乐！看来你已经意识到自己错过了某些核心剧情。具体来说就是夜总会里与小精灵相遇的部分。因此我建议你重新开始游戏，直接前往夜总会与小精灵见面。

Other than from a lore/story perspective, however, I *think* you should be fine.
不过从剧情/故事的角度来看，我认为你应该不会遇到问题。
For all its complexity, the game is fairly simple when it comes to judging whether or not something has happened, so I think you can still hit all the triggers you need to to progress in the story, if you want to.
尽管游戏机制复杂，但在判断事件是否发生时却相当简单。所以我认为，只要你愿意，仍然可以触发推进剧情所需的所有条件。

(1) OK, hi. I have a question, then. I'm about 2h in and after wandering around, I found the sales person in the hotel in the middle of the night and the game acted as though we had talked already. So he told me I lost my job, but I hadn't even begun, so that was confusing.
（1）好的，你好。我有个问题。我玩了大概两小时，在四处闲逛后，半夜在酒店里找到了销售员，但游戏表现得好像我们已经谈过话似的。所以他告诉我丢了工作，可我甚至还没开始上班，这让我很困惑。
I also think I missed something to do with Pixie cuz I didn't go with her to wherever when she asked me to come with her, and then one or two days later she mentioned a club I never heard of.
我也觉得我错过了和皮克西相关的某些内容，因为当她邀请我跟她一起去某个地方时我没有同行，结果一两天后她提到了一个我从未听说过的俱乐部。
I also goofed the quest to grab some red bag at the radio tower cuz I have no idea where this tower is. The NPC told me where it was, but it didn't help one bit.
我还搞砸了去无线电塔拿红色包裹的任务，因为我完全不知道这座塔在哪里。NPC 虽然告诉过我位置，但根本没什么帮助。

(2) So... I feel like starting over to try and get these things right, but is that actually necessary? Should I just keep exploring, stumbling around, *trying* to find out what I'm supposed to do?
（2）所以...我在考虑要不要重新开始把这些事情做好，但这真的有必要吗？还是应该继续探索，跌跌撞撞地*尝试*弄清自己该做什么？
I did find the hotel modifier, which led to some investigation report, which also reminded me of an event I triggered beside the shoe store which seemed to lead nowhere.
我确实找到了酒店修改器，这引出了一份调查报告，也让我想起在鞋店旁触发的一个看似毫无进展的事件。

I feel so lost and the game is clearly not waiting for me, so should I just go with it or start over?
我感到非常迷茫，而游戏显然不会等我，我是该继续随缘探索还是重新开始？

Thanks for the encouragement. I think I am getting somewhere now.
感谢鼓励。我觉得现在渐渐摸到门道了。

Lstor  [作者] 2020 年 5 月 24 日 上午 2:11 
@kibbles0515: Keep at it! You're nearly there. Keep exploring a bit more, and the game "open up". You haven't gotten to the good part yet.
@kibbles0515：坚持住！就差临门一脚了。再探索探索，游戏会"豁然开朗"。最精彩的部分还没到来呢。

kibbles0515 2020 年 5 月 23 日 上午 6:27 
@Lstor That's what I'm talking about. What the heck is a modifier? Where do I find one? I gave the girl at the shoe store a cigarette so I could get into the backroom, but there isn't anything there. I have no idea what's going on. lol.
@Lstor 这才对嘛。修改器到底是个啥玩意儿？上哪儿找去？我给鞋店那姑娘递了根烟才溜进后屋，结果里面啥也没有。完全搞不懂什么情况。笑死。
