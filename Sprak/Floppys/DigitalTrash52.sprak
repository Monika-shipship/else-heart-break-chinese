Neighbour, / 邻居，

I had to leave. It'll probably be a long time / 我不得不离开。可能要过很长一段时间
before you find this. / 你才会发现这个。

Didn't have the guts to tell you myself... / 我没有勇气亲口告诉你…
Gotta go. Dug too deep. Went too far. / 得走了。挖得太深了。走得太远了。
As I slept in my drug induced dreams / 当我在药物引起的梦中沉睡时
And crept beyond borders. I have been destroyed. / 我悄悄越过边界。我被毁灭了。

She's waiting for me at the 'Outpost' / 她在“前哨”等我

Yours truly, / 你真诚的，
Albert / 阿尔伯特
