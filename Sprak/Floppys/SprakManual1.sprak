Chapter 1 --- Introduction to problem solving
# 第 1 章 --- 解决问题的介绍
=============================================

How do you solve a problem? This is a tricky question
# 你如何解决一个问题？这确实是个棘手的问题。
for sure. After all, every problem is unique and
# 毕竟，每个问题都是独特的，
needs its own unique solution. Or does it?
# 需要它自己独特的解决方案。或者真的是这样吗？

A lot of similar, related problems in programming
# 在编程中，许多相似、相关的问题
come up again and again. An experienced programmer
# 会一次又一次地出现。一个有经验的程序员
might not have to think consciously at all about
# 可能根本不需要有意识地去思考
how to solve such situations. The right answer just
# 如何解决这些情况。正确的答案
appears in her or his head and can be typed into 
# 就出现在他或她的脑海里，并且可以毫不费力地
the computer without much thought at all.
# 输入到电脑里。

But how does one learn how to perform such a feat?
# 但是，一个人如何学会这样的壮举呢？
"Read code!" is an oft-repeated mantra for
# “读代码！”是年轻和缺乏经验的程序员
the young and inexperienced programmer. This tip
# 经常重复的口头禅。这个建议
is very good, naturally, but can be hard to follow
# 当然非常好，但在实践中可能很难遵循。
in practice. Many real-world solutions are both messy 
# 许多现实世界的解决方案既混乱
and poorly structured, with many strange details that
# 又结构不良，有许多奇怪的细节
make them both hard to read and reason about.
# 使它们难以阅读和理解。

Without guidance a page of code might be almost
# 没有指导，一页代码对于除了作者之外的任何人
impossible to understand for anyone except its author
# 几乎是不可能理解的
(and sometimes even her or him). Still, it IS very much
# （有时甚至包括作者本人）。尽管如此，
worthwhile trying to understand other people's code and 
# 尝试理解别人的代码并从中学习
pick up little things here and there, trying to find
# 零碎的知识，试图找到
patterns and exploring another person's solutions.
# 模式并探索另一个人的解决方案，这仍然是非常值得的。

A very good trick indeed can be to rewrite someone
# 一个非常好的技巧确实是重写某人
else's code with your own style and improvements.
# 的代码，用你自己的风格和改进。
This helps tremendously with understanding the flow
# 这极大地有助于理解
and connections in the written code.
# 书面代码中的流程和联系。

But back to problem solving! The main method of
# 但回到解决问题！解决问题的主要方法，
solving a problem, in programming and otherwise,
# 无论是在编程中还是在其他方面，
is to DECONSCTRUCT the problem and solve each
# 都是解构问题并单独解决每个
component individually. This simple method has proven
# 组件。这个简单的方法已经被证明
to be incredibly effective and lies at the heart
# 非常有效，并且是函数式组合（见第5章）
of both functional composition (see Chapter 5) and
# 和面向对象（见第9章）的核心。
object orientation (see Chapter 9).
# (此为上一句的延续)

By breaking things down into smaller and smaller 
# 通过将事物分解成越来越小的
pieces, something big and tangled can become quite
# 部分，一个庞大而纠结的东西可以变得相当
small and manageable. How to do this well is something
# 小而易于管理。如何做好这一点是我们
we will touch upon again and again throughout this
# 在本文中将反复提及的。通过分析手头的问题，
text. By analyzing the problem at hand and then trying
# 然后尝试将其拆解并用你将在后续章节中学到的
to take it apart and putting it together with the
# 不同结构将其重新组合，
different constructs you will learn in the following
# 希望你也能成为解决问题的大师！
chapters, hopefully you too can become a master of
# (此为上一句的延续)
problem solving!
# (此为上一句的延续)

Finally, if nothing works and a solution completely
# 最后，如果什么都不起作用，一个解决方案完全
eludes you - take a nap, walk away from your machine,
# 让你束手无策——打个盹，离开你的机器，
go for a walk or grab a sandwich. Nothing helps 
# 去散步或者吃个三明治。没有什么比睡眠和
problem solving as much as sleep and some fresh air.
# 新鲜空气更能帮助解决问题了。
